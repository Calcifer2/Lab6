down	1
by	1
its	1

with	1
one	1

she	1
rubbed	1
its	1
face	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
wrong	1
way	1
beginning	1
at	1
the	1

she	1

hard	1
at	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
white	1
kitten	1
which	1
was	1
lying	1
quite	1
still	1

that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1

good	1
	1
but	1
the	1

kitten	1
had	1
been	1
finished	1
with	1
earlier	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
and	1
so	1

curled	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1

been	1

a	1
grand	1
game	1
of	1

alice	1
had	1
been	1
trying	1

wind	1
up	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
rolling	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
till	1
it	1
had	1
all	1
come	1
undone	1
again	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
hearth	1
rug	1
all	1
knots	1
and	1
tangles	1
with	1
the	1

cried	1
alice	1

up	1
the	1

and	1
giving	1
it	1
a	1
little	1

that	1
it	1

in	1
as	1
cross	1
a	1
voice	1
as	1
she	1
could	1

and	1
then	1
she	1
scrambled	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
arm	1
chair	1
taking	1
the	1

very	1
demurely	1
on	1
her	1

pretending	1
to	1

into	1
your	1
eye	1
well	1
that	1
s	1
_your_	1
fault	1
for	1
keeping	1
your	1
eyes	1
open	1
if	1
you	1
d	1
shut	1

happened	1
now	1

t	1
make	1
any	1
more	1
excuses	1
but	1
listen	1
number	1
two	1
you	1
pulled	1
snowdrop	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
tail	1
just	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
put	1
down	1
the	1
saucer	1
of	1
milk	1
before	1
her	1
what	1
you	1

how	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
she	1
wasn	1
t	1
thirsty	1
too	1
now	1
for	1
number	1
three	1
you	1
unwound	1
every	1
bit	1
of	1
the	1
worsted	1
while	1
i	1
wasn	1
t	1
looking	1
	1
that	1
s	1
three	1
faults	1
kitty	1
and	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
been	1
punished	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
yet	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
m	1
saving	1
up	1
all	1
your	1
punishments	1
for	1
wednesday	1
week	1
suppose	1
they	1
had	1
saved	1
up	1
all	1
_my_	1
punishments	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
more	1
to	1
herself	1
than	1
the	1
kitten	1
what	1
_would_	1
they	1
do	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
year	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
prison	1
i	1
suppose	1
when	1
the	1
day	1
came	1
or	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
suppose	1
each	1
punishment	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
going	1
without	1
a	1
dinner	1
then	1
when	1
the	1
miserable	1
day	1
came	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
fifty	1
dinners	1
at	1
once	1
well	1
i	1
shouldn	1
t	1
mind	1
_that_	1
much	1
i	1
d	1
far	1
rather	1
go	1
without	1
them	1
than	1
eat	1
them	1
	1
do	1
you	1
hear	1
the	1
snow	1
against	1
the	1
window	1
panes	1
kitty	1
how	1
nice	1
and	1
soft	1
it	1
sounds	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
some	1
one	1
was	1
kissing	1
the	1
window	1
all	1
over	1
outside	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
the	1
snow	1
_loves_	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
fields	1
that	1
it	1
kisses	1
them	1
so	1
gently	1
and	1
then	1
it	1
covers	1
them	1
up	1
snug	1
you	1
know	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
quilt	1
and	1
perhaps	1
it	1
says	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
darlings	1
till	1
the	1
summer	1
comes	1
again	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
wake	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
kitty	1
they	1
dress	1
themselves	1
all	1
in	1
green	1
and	1
dance	1
about	1
whenever	1
the	1
wind	1
blows	1
oh	1
that	1
s	1
very	1
pretty	1
cried	1
alice	1
dropping	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
worsted	1
to	1
clap	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
i	1
do	1
so	1
_wish_	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
i	1
m	1
sure	1
the	1
woods	1
look	1
sleepy	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
when	1
the	1
leaves	1
are	1
getting	1
brown	1
	1
kitty	1
can	1
you	1
play	1
chess	1
now	1
don	1
t	1
smile	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
m	1
asking	1
it	1
seriously	1
because	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
playing	1
just	1
now	1
you	1
watched	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
understood	1
it	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
said	1
check	1
you	1
purred	1
well	1
it	1
_was_	1
a	1
nice	1
check	1
kitty	1
and	1
really	1
i	1
might	1
have	1
won	1
if	1
it	1
hadn	1
t	1
been	1
for	1
that	1
nasty	1
knight	1
that	1
came	1
wiggling	1
down	1
among	1
my	1
pieces	1
kitty	1
dear	1
let	1
s	1
pretend	1
and	1
here	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
tell	1
you	1
half	1
the	1
things	1
alice	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
beginning	1
with	1
her	1
favourite	1
phrase	1
let	1
s	1
pretend	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
quite	1
a	1
long	1
argument	1
with	1
her	1
sister	1
only	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
all	1
because	1
alice	1
had	1
begun	1
with	1
let	1
s	1
pretend	1
we	1
re	1
kings	1
and	1
queens	1
and	1
her	1
sister	1
who	1
liked	1
being	1
very	1
exact	1
had	1
argued	1
that	1
they	1
couldn	1
t	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
only	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
alice	1
had	1
been	1
reduced	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
say	1
well	1
_you_	1
can	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
then	1
and	1
_i	1
ll_	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
and	1
once	1
she	1
had	1
really	1
frightened	1
her	1
old	1
nurse	1
by	1
shouting	1
suddenly	1
in	1
her	1
ear	1
nurse	1
do	1
let	1
s	1
pretend	1
that	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
hungry	1
hyaena	1
and	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
bone	1
	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
taking	1
us	1
away	1
from	1
alice	1
s	1
speech	1
to	1
the	1
kitten	1
let	1
s	1
pretend	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
kitty	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
think	1
if	1
you	1
sat	1
up	1
and	1
folded	1
your	1
arms	1
you	1
d	1
look	1
exactly	1
like	1
her	1
now	1
do	1
try	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
dear	1
and	1
alice	1
got	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
off	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
up	1
before	1
the	1
kitten	1
as	1
a	1
model	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
imitate	1
however	1
the	1
thing	1
didn	1
t	1
succeed	1
principally	1
alice	1
said	1
because	1
the	1
kitten	1
wouldn	1
t	1
fold	1
its	1
arms	1
properly	1
so	1
to	1
punish	1
it	1
she	1
held	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
see	1
how	1
sulky	1
it	1
was	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
good	1
directly	1
she	1
added	1
i	1
ll	1
put	1
you	1
through	1
into	1
looking	1
glass	1
house	1
how	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
_that_	1
	1
now	1
if	1
you	1
ll	1
only	1
attend	1
kitty	1
and	1
not	1
talk	1
so	1
much	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
all	1
my	1
ideas	1
about	1
looking	1
glass	1
house	1
first	1
there	1
s	1
the	1
room	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
through	1
the	1
glass	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
our	1
drawing	1
room	1
only	1
the	1
things	1
go	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
i	1
can	1
see	1
all	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
i	1
get	1
upon	1
a	1
chair	1
all	1
but	1
the	1
bit	1
behind	1
the	1
fireplace	1
oh	1
i	1
do	1
so	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
see	1
_that_	1
bit	1
i	1
want	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
they	1
ve	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
winter	1
you	1
never	1
_can_	1
tell	1
you	1
know	1
unless	1
our	1
fire	1
smokes	1
and	1
then	1
smoke	1
comes	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
room	1
too	1
but	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
only	1
pretence	1
just	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
fire	1
well	1
then	1
the	1
books	1
are	1
something	1
like	1
our	1
books	1
only	1
the	1
words	1
go	1
the	1
wrong	1
way	1
i	1
know	1
that	1
because	1
i	1
ve	1
held	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
books	1
to	1
the	1
glass	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
hold	1
up	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
room	1
	1
how	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
looking	1
glass	1
house	1
kitty	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
they	1
d	1
give	1
you	1
milk	1
in	1
there	1
perhaps	1
looking	1
glass	1
milk	1
isn	1
t	1
good	1
to	1
drink	1
but	1
oh	1
kitty	1
now	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
passage	1
you	1
can	1
just	1
see	1
a	1
little	1
_peep_	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
in	1
looking	1
glass	1
house	1
if	1
you	1
leave	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
our	1
drawing	1
room	1
wide	1
open	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
like	1
our	1
passage	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
only	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
quite	1
different	1
on	1
beyond	1
oh	1
kitty	1
how	1
nice	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
through	1
into	1
looking	1
glass	1
house	1
i	1
m	1
sure	1
it	1
s	1
got	1
oh	1
such	1
beautiful	1
things	1
in	1
it	1
let	1
s	1
pretend	1
there	1
s	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
through	1
into	1
it	1
somehow	1
kitty	1
let	1
s	1
pretend	1
the	1
glass	1
has	1
got	1
all	1
soft	1
like	1
gauze	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
get	1
through	1
why	1
it	1
s	1
turning	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
mist	1
now	1
i	1
declare	1
it	1
ll	1
be	1
easy	1
enough	1
to	1
get	1
through	1
she	1
was	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
chimney	1
piece	1
while	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
though	1
she	1
hardly	1
knew	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
got	1
there	1
and	1
certainly	1
the	1
glass	1
_was_	1
beginning	1
to	1
melt	1
away	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
bright	1
silvery	1
mist	1
	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
alice	1
was	1
through	1
the	1
glass	1
and	1
had	1
jumped	1
lightly	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
room	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
thing	1
she	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
look	1
whether	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fire	1
in	1
the	1
fireplace	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
pleased	1
to	1
find	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
real	1
one	1
blazing	1
away	1
as	1
brightly	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
she	1
had	1
left	1
behind	1
so	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
warm	1
here	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
old	1
room	1
thought	1
alice	1
warmer	1
in	1
fact	1
because	1
there	1
ll	1
be	1
no	1
one	1
here	1
to	1
scold	1
me	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
fire	1
oh	1
what	1
fun	1
it	1
ll	1
be	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
glass	1
in	1
here	1
and	1
can	1
t	1
get	1
at	1
me	1
	1
then	1
she	1
began	1
looking	1
about	1
and	1
noticed	1
that	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
old	1
room	1
was	1
quite	1
common	1
and	1
uninteresting	1
but	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
was	1
as	1
different	1
as	1
possible	1
for	1
instance	1
the	1
pictures	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
next	1
the	1
fire	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
alive	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
clock	1
on	1
the	1
chimney	1
piece	1
you	1
know	1
you	1
can	1
only	1
see	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
had	1
got	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
grinned	1
at	1
her	1
	1
they	1
don	1
t	1
keep	1
this	1
room	1
so	1
tidy	1
as	1
the	1
other	1
alice	1
thought	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
noticed	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
chessmen	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
hearth	1
among	1
the	1
cinders	1
but	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
oh	1
of	1
surprise	1
she	1
was	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
knees	1
watching	1
them	1
the	1
chessmen	1
were	1
walking	1
about	1
two	1
and	1
two	1
	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
red	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
alice	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
frightening	1
them	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
white	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
queen	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
shovel	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
two	1

the	1

cried	1
out	1
as	1
she	1
rushed	1
past	1
the	1

so	1
violently	1
that	1

over	1

my	1

wildly	1
up	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
fender	1

the	1

rubbing	1
his	1

which	1
had	1

hurt	1
by	1
the	1
fall	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1

a	1
_little_	1
annoyed	1
with	1
the	1
queen	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
ashes	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
	1
alice	1
was	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
lily	1
was	1
nearly	1
screaming	1
herself	1
into	1
a	1
fit	1
she	1
hastily	1
picked	1
up	1
the	1
queen	1
and	1
set	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
her	1
noisy	1
little	1
daughter	1
	1
the	1
queen	1
gasped	1
and	1
sat	1
down	1
the	1
rapid	1
journey	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
had	1
quite	1
taken	1
away	1
her	1
breath	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
nothing	1
but	1
hug	1
the	1
little	1
lily	1
in	1
silence	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
recovered	1
her	1
breath	1
a	1
little	1
she	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
white	1
king	1
who	1
was	1
sitting	1
sulkily	1
among	1
the	1
ashes	1
mind	1
the	1
volcano	1
	1
what	1
volcano	1
said	1
the	1
king	1
looking	1
up	1
anxiously	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
likely	1
place	1
to	1
find	1
one	1
	1
blew	1
me	1
up	1
panted	1
the	1
queen	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
a	1
little	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
mind	1
you	1
come	1
up	1
the	1
regular	1
way	1
don	1
t	1
get	1
blown	1
up	1
	1
alice	1
watched	1
the	1
white	1
king	1
as	1
he	1
slowly	1
struggled	1
up	1
from	1
bar	1
to	1
bar	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
said	1
why	1
you	1
ll	1
be	1
hours	1
and	1
hours	1
getting	1
to	1
the	1
table	1
at	1
that	1
rate	1
i	1
d	1
far	1
better	1
help	1
you	1
hadn	1
t	1
i	1
but	1
the	1
king	1
took	1
no	1
notice	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
it	1
was	1
quite	1
clear	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
neither	1
hear	1
her	1
nor	1
see	1
her	1
	1
so	1
alice	1
picked	1
him	1
up	1
very	1
gently	1
and	1
lifted	1
him	1
across	1
more	1
slowly	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
lifted	1
the	1
queen	1
that	1
she	1
mightn	1
t	1
take	1
his	1
breath	1
away	1
but	1
before	1
she	1
put	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
dust	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
covered	1
with	1
ashes	1
	1
she	1
said	1
afterwards	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
such	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
made	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
by	1
an	1
invisible	1
hand	1
and	1
being	1
dusted	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
too	1
much	1
astonished	1
to	1
cry	1
out	1
but	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
went	1
on	1
getting	1
larger	1
and	1
larger	1
and	1
rounder	1
and	1
rounder	1
till	1
her	1
hand	1
shook	1
so	1
with	1
laughing	1
that	1
she	1
nearly	1
let	1
him	1
drop	1
upon	1
the	1
floor	1
	1
oh	1
_please_	1
don	1
t	1
make	1
such	1
faces	1
my	1
dear	1
she	1
cried	1
out	1
quite	1
forgetting	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
couldn	1
t	1
hear	1
her	1
you	1
make	1
me	1
laugh	1
so	1
that	1
i	1
can	1
hardly	1
hold	1
you	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
keep	1
your	1
mouth	1
so	1
wide	1
open	1
all	1
the	1
ashes	1
will	1
get	1
into	1
it	1
there	1
now	1
i	1
think	1
you	1
re	1
tidy	1
enough	1
she	1
added	1
as	1
she	1
smoothed	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1
near	1
the	1
queen	1
	1
the	1
king	1
immediately	1
fell	1
flat	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
lay	1
perfectly	1
still	1
and	1
alice	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
alarmed	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
and	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
find	1
any	1
water	1
to	1
throw	1
over	1
him	1
however	1
she	1
could	1
find	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
bottle	1
of	1
ink	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
got	1
back	1
with	1
it	1
she	1
found	1
he	1
had	1
recovered	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
were	1
talking	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
frightened	1
whisper	1
so	1
low	1
that	1
alice	1
could	1
hardly	1
hear	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
	1
the	1
king	1
was	1
saying	1
i	1
assure	1
you	1
my	1
dear	1
i	1
turned	1
cold	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
ends	1
of	1
my	1
whiskers	1
	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
queen	1
replied	1
you	1
haven	1
t	1
got	1
any	1
whiskers	1
	1
the	1
horror	1
of	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
king	1
went	1
on	1
i	1
shall	1
never	1
_never_	1
forget	1
	1
you	1
will	1
though	1
the	1
queen	1
said	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
make	1
a	1
memorandum	1
of	1
it	1
	1
alice	1
looked	1
on	1
with	1
great	1
interest	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
took	1
an	1
enormous	1
memorandum	1
book	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
began	1
writing	1
a	1
sudden	1
thought	1
struck	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
pencil	1
which	1
came	1
some	1
way	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
and	1
began	1
writing	1
for	1
him	1
	1
the	1
poor	1
king	1
looked	1
puzzled	1
and	1
unhappy	1
and	1
struggled	1
with	1
the	1
pencil	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
but	1
alice	1
was	1
too	1
strong	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
panted	1
out	1
my	1
dear	1

really	1
_must_	1

invention	1
of	1
hers	1
for	1
getting	1
down	1
stairs	1
quickly	1
and	1
easily	1
as	1
alice	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
just	1
kept	1
the	1
tips	1
of	1
her	1

on	1

gently	1
down	1
without	1
even	1
touching	1
the	1
stairs	1
with	1
her	1
feet	1
then	1
she	1
floated	1
on	1
through	1
the	1
hall	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
straight	1
out	1
at	1
the	1

in	1
the	1

was	1
getting	1
a	1
little	1
giddy	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
floating	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
was	1
rather	1
glad	1
to	1

alice	1
to	1

if	1
i	1

to	1

here	1
s	1
a	1

to	1
it	1
at	1

no	1

yards	1
along	1
the	1

and	1

several	1
sharp	1
corners	1
but	1
i	1
suppose	1
it	1
will	1
at	1
last	1
but	1
how	1
curiously	1
it	1
twists	1
it	1
s	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
corkscrew	1
than	1
a	1
path	1
well	1
_this_	1

it	1
the	1

did	1
wandering	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
and	1
trying	1
turn	1
after	1

always	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
the	1

what	1
she	1
would	1
indeed	1
once	1
when	1
she	1
turned	1
a	1
corner	1
rather	1
more	1
quickly	1
than	1
usual	1
she	1

against	1

looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
pretending	1
it	1
was	1
arguing	1
with	1
her	1
i	1
m	1
_not_	1
going	1
in	1
again	1
yet	1
i	1

to	1

through	1
the	1

glass	1
again	1
back	1
into	1
the	1

there	1
d	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
adventures	1
	1
so	1
resolutely	1
turning	1
her	1
back	1
upon	1
the	1
house	1
she	1
set	1
out	1
once	1
more	1
down	1
the	1
path	1
determined	1
to	1
keep	1
straight	1
on	1
till	1
she	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
hill	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
all	1
went	1
on	1
well	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
saying	1
i	1
really	1
_shall_	1
do	1
it	1
this	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
path	1
gave	1
a	1
sudden	1
twist	1
and	1
shook	1
itself	1
as	1
she	1
described	1
it	1
afterwards	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
actually	1
walking	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
	1
oh	1
it	1
s	1
too	1
bad	1
she	1
cried	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
such	1
a	1
house	1
for	1
getting	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
never	1
	1
however	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
hill	1
full	1
in	1
sight	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
but	1
start	1
again	1
this	1
time	1
she	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
large	1
flower	1
bed	1
with	1
a	1
border	1
of	1
daisies	1

herself	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
waving	1
gracefully	1
about	1
in	1
the	1

i	1
_wish_	1

could	1
talk	1
	1

when	1
there	1
s	1
anybody	1
worth	1
talking	1
to	1
	1
alice	1
was	1
so	1
astonished	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
speak	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
it	1
quite	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
breath	1
away	1
at	1
length	1
as	1
the	1
tiger	1
lily	1
only	1
went	1
on	1
waving	1
about	1
she	1
spoke	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
timid	1
voice	1
almost	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
and	1
can	1
_all_	1
the	1
flowers	1
talk	1
	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
_you_	1

i	1

wondering	1
when	1

myself	1

right	1
	1
alice	1
didn	1
t	1
like	1
being	1
criticised	1
so	1
she	1
began	1
asking	1
questions	1
aren	1
t	1
you	1
sometimes	1
frightened	1
at	1
being	1
planted	1
out	1
here	1
with	1
nobody	1
to	1
take	1

of	1
you	1
	1
there	1
s	1
the	1
tree	1
in	1

the	1
rose	1
what	1
else	1

it	1
good	1
for	1
	1

what	1

if	1

alice	1
asked	1

cried	1
another	1
daisy	1
and	1
here	1
they	1
all	1
began	1
shouting	1
together	1
till	1
the	1
air	1
seemed	1
quite	1
full	1
of	1
little	1
shrill	1
voices	1

of	1

waving	1
itself	1
passionately	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1

with	1

in	1
a	1
soothing	1
tone	1
and	1
stooping	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
daisies	1
who	1
were	1
just	1
beginning	1
again	1
she	1
whispered	1
if	1
you	1

t	1

your	1
tongues	1
i	1

in	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
pink	1
daisies	1
turned	1
white	1
	1
that	1
s	1
right	1
said	1
the	1
tiger	1
lily	1
the	1
daisies	1
are	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
when	1
one	1
speaks	1
they	1
all	1
begin	1
together	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
wither	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
go	1
on	1
	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
can	1
all	1
talk	1
so	1
nicely	1
alice	1
said	1
hoping	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
better	1
temper	1
by	1
a	1
compliment	1
i	1
ve	1
been	1
in	1
many	1
gardens	1
before	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
flowers	1
could	1
talk	1
	1
put	1
your	1
hand	1
down	1
and	1
feel	1
the	1
ground	1
said	1
the	1
tiger	1
lily	1
then	1
you	1
ll	1
know	1
why	1
	1
alice	1
did	1
so	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
hard	1
she	1
said	1
but	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
see	1
what	1
that	1
has	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it	1
	1
in	1
most	1
gardens	1
the	1
tiger	1
lily	1
said	1
they	1
make	1
the	1
beds	1
too	1
soft	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
flowers	1
are	1
always	1
asleep	1
	1
this	1
sounded	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
reason	1
and	1
alice	1
was	1
quite	1
pleased	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
i	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
before	1

	1
it	1
s	1
_my_	1
opinion	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
think	1
_at	1
all_	1

rose	1

in	1
a	1
rather	1
severe	1
tone	1
	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
anybody	1
that	1
looked	1
stupider	1
a	1
violet	1
said	1
so	1
suddenly	1
that	1
alice	1
quite	1
jumped	1
for	1
it	1
hadn	1
t	1
spoken	1
before	1
	1
hold	1
_your_	1
tongue	1
cried	1
the	1
tiger	1
lily	1
as	1
if	1
_you_	1
ever	1
saw	1
anybody	1
you	1
keep	1
your	1
head	1
under	1
the	1
leaves	1
and	1
snore	1
away	1
there	1
till	1
you	1
know	1
no	1
more	1
what	1
s	1
going	1
on	1
in	1

a	1
bud	1
	1
are	1
there	1
any	1
more	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
besides	1
me	1
alice	1
said	1
not	1
choosing	1
to	1
notice	1
the	1
rose	1
s	1
last	1
remark	1
	1
there	1

other	1
flower	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
that	1
can	1
move	1
about	1
like	1
you	1
said	1
the	1

i	1
wonder	1
how	1
you	1
do	1
it	1
you	1
re	1
always	1
wondering	1
said	1
the	1
tiger	1
lily	1
but	1
she	1

more	1
bushy	1
than	1
you	1

alice	1
asked	1
eagerly	1
for	1
the	1

there	1
s	1
another	1
little	1

has	1
the	1
same	1
awkward	1
shape	1
as	1
you	1
the	1
rose	1

but	1
she	1
s	1
redder	1
and	1
her	1
petals	1
are	1
shorter	1
i	1
think	1
	1
her	1
petals	1
are	1
done	1
up	1
close	1
almost	1
like	1
a	1
dahlia	1

tiger	1
lily	1
interrupted	1
not	1
tumbled	1
about	1
anyhow	1
like	1
yours	1
	1

that	1
s	1
not	1
_your_	1
fault	1

rose	1
added	1
kindly	1
you	1
re	1
beginning	1
to	1

with	1
some	1
curiosity	1
	1
why	1

had	1
indeed	1
when	1
alice	1
first	1
found	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
ashes	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
only	1
three	1
inches	1
high	1
and	1
here	1
she	1
was	1
half	1
a	1
head	1
taller	1
than	1
alice	1
herself	1
	1
it	1
s	1
the	1
fresh	1
air	1
that	1
does	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
rose	1
wonderfully	1
fine	1
air	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
here	1
	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
ll	1
go	1
and	1
meet	1
her	1
said	1
alice	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
flowers	1
were	1
interesting	1
enough	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
far	1
grander	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
a	1
real	1
queen	1
	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
possibly	1
do	1
that	1
said	1
the	1
rose	1
_i_	1
should	1
advise	1
you	1
to	1
walk	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
	1
this	1
sounded	1
nonsense	1
to	1
alice	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
once	1
towards	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
to	1
her	1
surprise	1
she	1
lost	1
sight	1
of	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
found	1
herself	1
walking	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
front	1
door	1
again	1
	1
a	1
little	1
provoked	1
she	1
drew	1
back	1
and	1
after	1
looking	1
everywhere	1
for	1
the	1
queen	1
whom	1
she	1
spied	1
out	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
off	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1
would	1
try	1
the	1
plan	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
direction	1
	1
it	1
succeeded	1
beautifully	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
walking	1
a	1
minute	1
before	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
and	1
full	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
hill	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
aiming	1
at	1
	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
come	1
from	1
said	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
and	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
look	1
up	1
speak	1
nicely	1
and	1
don	1
t	1
twiddle	1
your	1
fingers	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
	1
alice	1
attended	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
directions	1
and	1
explained	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
way	1
	1
i	1
don	1
t	1

what	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
_your_	1
way	1

the	1
queen	1
all	1
the	1
ways	1
about	1

_me_	1
but	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
come	1
out	1
here	1
at	1
all	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
kinder	1
tone	1
curtsey	1
while	1
you	1
re	1
thinking	1
what	1
to	1

it	1
saves	1
time	1
	1
alice	1
wondered	1
a	1
little	1
at	1
this	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
too	1
much	1
in	1
awe	1
of	1
the	1
queen	1
to	1
disbelieve	1
it	1
i	1
ll	1
try	1
it	1
when	1
i	1
go	1
home	1

to	1
herself	1
the	1
next	1

m	1
a	1

late	1
for	1

it	1
s	1

for	1
you	1
to	1

now	1
the	1
queen	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
watch	1
open	1
your	1
mouth	1
a	1
_little_	1
wider	1
when	1
you	1

and	1
always	1
say	1
your	1
majesty	1
	1
i	1
only	1
wanted	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
garden	1
was	1
like	1
your	1
majesty	1
	1
that	1
s	1

the	1
queen	1
patting	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
which	1
alice	1
didn	1
t	1

	1
alice	1
didn	1
t	1

to	1
argue	1
the	1
point	1

went	1
on	1
and	1
i	1

as	1
a	1

	1
alice	1
curtseyed	1
again	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
from	1
the	1
queen	1
s	1
tone	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
_little_	1
offended	1
and	1
they	1
walked	1
on	1
in	1
silence	1
till	1
they	1
got	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
hill	1
	1
for	1
some	1
minutes	1
alice	1
stood	1
without	1
speaking	1
looking	1
out	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
over	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
a	1
most	1
curious	1
country	1
it	1
was	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
tiny	1
little	1
brooks	1
running	1
straight	1
across	1
it	1
from	1

and	1
the	1
ground	1
between	1

up	1
into	1
squares	1
by	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
little	1
green	1
hedges	1

declare	1
it	1

marked	1
out	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
large	1
chessboard	1
alice	1

at	1

there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
men	1
moving	1
about	1

and	1
so	1
there	1
are	1
she	1
added	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
delight	1
and	1
her	1
heart	1
began	1
to	1
beat	1
quick	1
with	1
excitement	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
it	1
s	1
a	1

a	1

glanced	1
rather	1
shyly	1
at	1
the	1

as	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
but	1
her	1

only	1
smiled	1
pleasantly	1
and	1

the	1
white	1

you	1
re	1
in	1
the	1

to	1
begin	1
with	1
when	1
you	1

to	1
the	1
eighth	1
square	1
you	1
ll	1
be	1
a	1
queen	1
just	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
somehow	1
or	1
other	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
	1
alice	1
never	1
could	1
quite	1
make	1
out	1
in	1
thinking	1
it	1
over	1
afterwards	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
began	1
all	1
she	1
remembers	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
running	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
went	1
so	1
fast	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
queen	1
kept	1
crying	1
faster	1
faster	1
but	1
alice	1
felt	1
she	1
_could	1
not_	1
go	1
faster	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
breath	1
left	1
to	1
say	1
so	1
	1
the	1
most	1
curious	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
things	1
round	1
them	1
never	1
changed	1
their	1
places	1
at	1
all	1
however	1
fast	1
they	1
went	1
they	1
never	1
seemed	1
to	1
pass	1
anything	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
move	1
along	1
with	1
us	1
thought	1
poor	1
puzzled	1
alice	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
seemed	1
to	1
guess	1
her	1
thoughts	1
for	1
she	1
cried	1
faster	1
don	1
t	1
try	1
to	1
talk	1
	1
not	1
that	1
alice	1
had	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
doing	1
_that_	1
she	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
talk	1
again	1
she	1
was	1
getting	1
so	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
queen	1
cried	1
faster	1
faster	1
and	1
dragged	1
her	1
along	1
are	1
we	1
nearly	1
there	1
alice	1
managed	1
to	1
pant	1
out	1
at	1
last	1
	1
nearly	1
there	1
the	1
queen	1
repeated	1
why	1
we	1
passed	1
it	1
ten	1
minutes	1
ago	1
faster	1
and	1
they	1
ran	1
on	1
for	1
a	1
time	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
whistling	1
in	1
alice	1
s	1
ears	1
and	1
almost	1
blowing	1
her	1
hair	1
off	1
her	1
head	1
she	1
fancied	1
	1
now	1
now	1
cried	1
the	1
queen	1
faster	1
faster	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
so	1
fast	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
skim	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
hardly	1
touching	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
their	1
feet	1
till	1
suddenly	1
just	1
as	1
alice	1
was	1
getting	1
quite	1
exhausted	1
they	1
stopped	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
breathless	1
and	1
giddy	1
	1
the	1
queen	1
propped	1
her	1
up	1
against	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
said	1
kindly	1
you	1
may	1
rest	1
a	1
little	1
now	1
	1
alice	1
looked	1
round	1
her	1
in	1
great	1
surprise	1
why	1

to	1
somewhere	1

very	1
fast	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
as	1
we	1

	1
a	1

if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1

somewhere	1

you	1
must	1
run	1
at	1

twice	1
as	1

as	1
that	1
	1
i	1

off	1
you	1

and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
she	1
stood	1
silent	1
watching	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
was	1
bustling	1
about	1
among	1
the	1
flowers	1
poking	1
its	1
proboscis	1
into	1
them	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
it	1

it	1
was	1
an	1
elephant	1
as	1
alice	1
soon	1
found	1
out	1
though	1
the	1
idea	1
quite	1
took	1
her	1
breath	1
away	1
at	1
first	1
and	1
what	1
enormous	1
flowers	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
was	1
her	1
next	1
idea	1
something	1
like	1
cottages	1
with	1
the	1
roofs	1
taken	1
off	1
and	1
stalks	1
put	1
to	1
them	1
and	1
what	1
quantities	1
of	1
honey	1
they	1
must	1
make	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
ll	1
go	1
down	1
and	1
no	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
_just_	1
yet	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
checking	1
herself	1
just	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
run	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
excuse	1
for	1
turning	1
shy	1
so	1
suddenly	1
it	1
ll	1
never	1
do	1
to	1
go	1
down	1
among	1
them	1
without	1
a	1
good	1
long	1
branch	1
to	1
brush	1
them	1
away	1
and	1
what	1
fun	1
it	1
ll	1
be	1
when	1
they	1
ask	1
me	1
how	1
i	1
like	1
my	1
walk	1
i	1
shall	1
say	1
oh	1

it	1
well	1
enough	1
here	1
came	1
the	1
favourite	1
little	1
toss	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
only	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
dusty	1
and	1
hot	1
and	1
the	1
elephants	1
did	1
tease	1
so	1
	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
ll	1
go	1
down	1
the	1
other	1
way	1
she	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
and	1
perhaps	1
i	1
may	1
visit	1
the	1
elephants	1
later	1
on	1
besides	1
i	1
do	1
so	1
want	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
third	1
square	1
	1
so	1
with	1
this	1
excuse	1
she	1
ran	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
jumped	1
over	1

she	1
must	1
draw	1
the	1

herself	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
so	1
on	1
	1
but	1
the	1
gentleman	1
dressed	1
in	1
white	1
paper	1
leaned	1
forwards	1
and	1
whispered	1
in	1
her	1
ear	1
never	1
mind	1
what	1
they	1
all	1
say	1
my	1

take	1
a	1
return	1
ticket	1
every	1
time	1
the	1
train	1
stops	1
	1
indeed	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1
alice	1
said	1
rather	1
impatiently	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
belong	1
to	1
this	1
railway	1
journey	1
at	1
all	1
i	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
wood	1
just	1
now	1
and	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
back	1
there	1
	1
you	1
might	1
make	1
a	1
joke	1
on	1
_that_	1
said	1
the	1
little	1
voice	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
ear	1
something	1
about	1
you	1
_would_	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
you	1
know	1
	1
don	1
t	1
tease	1
so	1
said	1
alice	1
looking	1
about	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
see	1
where	1
the	1
voice	1
came	1
from	1
if	1
you	1
re	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
joke	1
made	1
why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
make	1
one	1
yourself	1
	1
the	1
little	1
voice	1
sighed	1
deeply	1
it	1
was	1
_very_	1
unhappy	1
evidently	1
and	1
alice	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
something	1
pitying	1
to	1
comfort	1
it	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
only	1
sigh	1
like	1
other	1
people	1
she	1
thought	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
wonderfully	1
small	1
sigh	1
that	1
she	1
wouldn	1
t	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
if	1
it	1
hadn	1
t	1
come	1
_quite_	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
ear	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
this	1
was	1
that	1
it	1
tickled	1
her	1
ear	1
very	1
much	1
and	1
quite	1
took	1
off	1
her	1
thoughts	1
from	1
the	1
unhappiness	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
creature	1
	1
i	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
friend	1
the	1
little	1
voice	1
went	1
on	1
a	1
dear	1
friend	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
friend	1
and	1
you	1
won	1
t	1
hurt	1
me	1
though	1
i	1
_am_	1
an	1
insect	1
	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
insect	1
alice	1
inquired	1
a	1
little	1
anxiously	1
what	1
she	1
really	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
was	1
whether	1
it	1
could	1
sting	1
or	1
not	1
but	1
she	1
thought	1
this	1
wouldn	1
t	1
be	1
quite	1
a	1
civil	1
question	1
to	1
ask	1
	1
what	1
then	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
the	1
little	1
voice	1
began	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
drowned	1
by	1
a	1
shrill	1
scream	1
from	1
the	1
engine	1
and	1
everybody	1
jumped	1
up	1
in	1
alarm	1
alice	1
among	1
the	1
rest	1
	1
the	1
horse	1
who	1
had	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
quietly	1
drew	1
it	1
in	1
and	1
said	1
it	1
s	1
only	1
a	1
brook	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
jump	1
over	1
everybody	1
seemed	1
satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
though	1
alice	1
felt	1
a	1
little	1
nervous	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
trains	1
jumping	1
at	1
all	1
however	1
it	1
ll	1
take	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
fourth	1
square	1
that	1
s	1
some	1
comfort	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
she	1
felt	1
the	1
carriage	1
rise	1
straight	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
fright	1
she	1
caught	1
at	1
the	1
thing	1
nearest	1
to	1
her	1
hand	1
which	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
goat	1
s	1
beard	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
but	1
the	1
beard	1
seemed	1
to	1
melt	1
away	1
as	1
she	1
touched	1
it	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
sitting	1
quietly	1
under	1
a	1
tree	1
while	1
the	1
gnat	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
insect	1

had	1
been	1
talking	1
to	1
was	1
balancing	1
itself	1
on	1
a	1
twig	1
just	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
fanning	1
her	1
with	1
its	1
wings	1
	1
it	1
certainly	1
was	1
a	1
_very_	1
large	1
gnat	1
about	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
chicken	1
alice	1
thought	1
still	1
she	1
couldn	1
t	1
feel	1
nervous	1
with	1
it	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
together	1
so	1
long	1
	1
then	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
like	1
all	1
insects	1
the	1
gnat	1
went	1
on	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened	1
	1
i	1
like	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
can	1
talk	1
alice	1
said	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
ever	1
talk	1
where	1
_i_	1
come	1
from	1
	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
insects	1
do	1
you	1
rejoice	1
in	1
where	1
_you_	1
come	1
from	1
the	1

inquired	1
	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
_rejoice_	1
in	1
insects	1
at	1
all	1
alice	1
explained	1
because	1
i	1
m	1
rather	1
afraid	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
large	1
kinds	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
names	1
of	1

to	1
their	1

	1
no	1

up	1
at	1
the	1

with	1
great	1
interest	1

made	1
up	1

just	1
repainted	1
it	1
looked	1
so	1
bright	1
and	1
sticky	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
	1
and	1
there	1
s	1

dragon	1

	1
look	1
on	1
the	1

there	1
you	1

a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
insect	1
with	1
its	1
head	1
on	1
fire	1
and	1
had	1
thought	1
to	1
herself	1
i	1
wonder	1
if	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
reason	1
insects	1
are	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
flying	1
into	1

flies	1
	1
crawling	1
at	1
your	1

the	1

alice	1
drew	1
her	1

back	1
in	1
some	1
alarm	1

may	1
observe	1
a	1

on	1
	1
weak	1
tea	1
with	1
cream	1
in	1
it	1
	1
a	1
new	1
difficulty	1
came	1
into	1
alice	1

head	1
supposing	1
it	1
couldn	1
t	1

any	1
she	1

	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
die	1
of	1
course	1
	1
but	1
that	1
must	1
happen	1
very	1
often	1
alice	1
remarked	1
thoughtfully	1
	1
it	1
always	1

the	1
gnat	1
	1
after	1
this	1

was	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
pondering	1

amused	1
itself	1

by	1
humming	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
her	1
head	1
at	1

one	1
	1

the	1

deeply	1

another	1

away	1
for	1

up	1

was	1
nothing	1

came	1
to	1
an	1
open	1
field	1
with	1
a	1
wood	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
it	1
looked	1
much	1
darker	1
than	1
the	1
last	1
wood	1
and	1
alice	1
felt	1
a	1
_little_	1
timid	1
about	1
going	1
into	1
it	1
however	1
on	1
second	1
thoughts	1
she	1
made	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
for	1
i	1
certainly	1
won	1
t	1
go	1
_back_	1
she	1
thought	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
eighth	1
square	1
	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
wood	1
she	1
said	1
thoughtfully	1
to	1
herself	1
where	1
things	1
have	1
no	1
names	1
i	1
wonder	1
what	1
ll	1
become	1
of	1
_my_	1
name	1
when	1
i	1
go	1
in	1
i	1
shouldn	1
t	1
like	1
to	1
lose	1
it	1
at	1
all	1
because	1
they	1
d	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
another	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
almost	1
certain	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
ugly	1
one	1
but	1
then	1
the	1
fun	1
would	1
be	1
trying	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
creature	1
that	1
had	1
got	1
my	1
old	1
name	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
like	1
the	1
advertisements	1

just	1

calling	1
everything	1
you	1
met	1
alice	1
till	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
answered	1
only	1
they	1
wouldn	1
t	1
answer	1
at	1
all	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
wise	1
	1
she	1
was	1
rambling	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
when	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
wood	1
it	1
looked	1
very	1
cool	1
and	1
shady	1
well	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
great	1
comfort	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
she	1
stepped	1
under	1
the	1
trees	1
after	1
being	1
so	1
hot	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
the	1
into	1
_what_	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
rather	1
surprised	1
at	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1

her	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
the	1
tree	1
what	1
_does_	1
it	1

itself	1
i	1
wonder	1
i	1
do	1
believe	1
it	1
s	1
got	1
no	1
name	1
why	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
it	1
hasn	1
t	1
	1
she	1
stood	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
thinking	1
then	1
she	1
suddenly	1
began	1
again	1
then	1
it	1
really	1
_has_	1
happened	1
after	1
all	1
and	1
now	1
who	1
am	1
i	1
i	1
_will_	1

to	1

it	1
but	1
being	1
determined	1
didn	1
t	1
help	1
much	1
and	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
after	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
puzzling	1

l	1
i	1
_know_	1
it	1

with	1
l	1
	1
just	1
then	1
a	1
fawn	1
came	1
wandering	1
by	1
it	1
looked	1
at	1
alice	1
with	1
its	1
large	1
gentle	1
eyes	1
but	1
didn	1
t	1
seem	1
at	1
all	1
frightened	1
here	1
then	1
here	1
then	1
alice	1
said	1
as	1
she	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
stroke	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
only	1
started	1
back	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
then	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
again	1
	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
yourself	1
the	1
fawn	1

at	1
last	1
such	1
a	1
soft	1
sweet	1
voice	1
it	1
had	1
	1
i	1
wish	1
i	1
knew	1
thought	1
poor	1
alice	1
she	1
answered	1
rather	1
sadly	1
nothing	1
just	1
now	1
	1

again	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
won	1
t	1

	1
alice	1
thought	1
but	1
nothing	1

of	1
it	1
please	1
would	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
_you_	1
call	1
yourself	1
she	1
said	1
timidly	1
i	1
think	1
that	1
might	1
help	1
a	1
little	1
	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1

a	1
little	1
further	1
on	1
the	1
fawn	1
said	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
remember	1
here	1
	1
so	1
they	1
walked	1
on	1
together	1
though	1
the	1
wood	1
alice	1
with	1
her	1
arms	1
clasped	1
lovingly	1
round	1
the	1
soft	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
fawn	1
till	1
they	1
came	1
out	1
into	1
another	1
open	1
field	1
and	1
here	1
the	1
fawn	1
gave	1
a	1
sudden	1
bound	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
shook	1
itself	1
free	1
from	1
alice	1
s	1
arms	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
fawn	1
it	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
delight	1
and	1
dear	1
me	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
human	1
child	1
a	1
sudden	1
look	1
of	1
alarm	1
came	1
into	1
its	1
beautiful	1
brown	1
eyes	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
it	1
had	1
darted	1
away	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
	1
alice	1
stood	1
looking	1
after	1
it	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
cry	1
with	1
vexation	1
at	1
having	1
lost	1
her	1
dear	1
little	1
fellow	1
traveller	1
so	1
suddenly	1
however	1
i	1
know	1
my	1
name	1
now	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
s	1
_some_	1
comfort	1
alice	1
alice	1
i	1
won	1
t	1
forget	1
it	1
again	1
and	1
now	1
which	1
of	1
these	1
finger	1
posts	1
ought	1
i	1
to	1
follow	1
i	1
wonder	1
	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
difficult	1
question	1
to	1
answer	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
one	1
road	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
finger	1
posts	1
both	1
pointed	1
along	1
it	1
i	1
ll	1
settle	1
it	1
alice	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
when	1
the	1
road	1
divides	1
and	1
they	1
point	1
different	1
ways	1
	1
but	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
likely	1
to	1
happen	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
but	1
wherever	1
the	1
road	1
divided	1
there	1
were	1
sure	1
to	1
be	1
two	1
finger	1
posts	1
pointing	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
one	1
marked	1
to	1
tweedledum	1
s	1
house	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
tweedledee	1
	1
i	1
do	1
believe	1
said	1
alice	1
at	1
last	1
that	1
they	1
live	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
house	1
i	1
wonder	1
i	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
that	1
before	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
stay	1
there	1
long	1
i	1
ll	1
just	1
call	1
and	1
say	1
how	1
d	1
you	1
do	1
and	1
ask	1
them	1
the	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
if	1
i	1
could	1
only	1
get	1
to	1
the	1
eighth	1
square	1
before	1
it	1
gets	1
dark	1
so	1
she	1
wandered	1
on	1
talking	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
till	1
on	1
turning	1
a	1
sharp	1
corner	1
she	1
came	1
upon	1
two	1
fat	1
little	1
men	1
so	1
suddenly	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
starting	1
back	1
but	1
in	1
another	1
moment	1
she	1
recovered	1
herself	1
feeling	1
sure	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
chapter	1
iv	1
tweedledum	1
and	1
tweedledee	1
	1
	1
they	1
were	1
standing	1
under	1
a	1
tree	1
each	1
with	1
an	1
arm	1
round	1
the	1
other	1
s	1
neck	1
and	1
alice	1
knew	1
which	1
was	1
which	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
because	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
dum	1
embroidered	1
on	1
his	1
collar	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
dee	1
i	1

got	1
tweedle	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
collar	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
	1
they	1
stood	1
so	1
still	1
that	1
she	1
quite	1
forgot	1
they	1
were	1
alive	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
just	1
looking	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
word	1
tweedle	1
was	1
written	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
each	1
collar	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
startled	1
by	1
a	1
voice	1
coming	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
marked	1

	1

i	1
m	1
very	1
sorry	1

all	1
alice	1
could	1
say	1
for	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
song	1
kept	1
ringing	1
through	1
her	1
head	1
like	1
the	1
ticking	1
of	1
a	1
clock	1
and	1
she	1
could	1
hardly	1
help	1
saying	1
them	1
out	1
loud	1
	1
tweedledum	1
and	1
tweedledee	1
agreed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
battle	1
for	1

said	1
tweedledee	1
had	1
spoiled	1
his	1
nice	1
new	1
rattle	1
	1
just	1
then	1
flew	1
down	1
a	1
monstrous	1
crow	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
a	1
tar	1
barrel	1
which	1
frightened	1
both	1
the	1
heroes	1
so	1
they	1
quite	1
forgot	1
their	1
quarrel	1
	1
	1
i	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
re	1
thinking	1
about	1

but	1
it	1
isn	1
t	1
so	1
nohow	1
	1
contrariwise	1
continued	1
tweedledee	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
but	1
as	1
it	1

ain	1
t	1
that	1
s	1
logic	1
	1
i	1
was	1
thinking	1
alice	1
said	1
very	1
politely	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
wood	1
it	1
s	1
getting	1
so	1
dark	1
would	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
please	1
	1
but	1
the	1
little	1
men	1
only	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
and	1
grinned	1
	1
they	1
looked	1
so	1
exactly	1
like	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
great	1
schoolboys	1
that	1
alice	1
couldn	1
t	1
help	1
pointing	1
her	1
finger	1
at	1
tweedledum	1
and	1
saying	1
first	1
boy	1
	1
nohow	1
tweedledum	1
cried	1
out	1
briskly	1
and	1
shut	1
his	1
mouth	1
up	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
snap	1
	1
next	1
boy	1
said	1
alice	1
passing	1
on	1
to	1
tweedledee	1
though	1
she	1
felt	1
quite	1
certain	1
he	1
would	1
only	1
shout	1
out	1
contrariwise	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
wrong	1
cried	1
tweedledum	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
in	1
a	1
visit	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
d	1
ye	1
do	1
and	1
shake	1
hands	1
and	1
here	1
the	1
two	1
brothers	1
gave	1
each	1
other	1
a	1
hug	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
held	1
out	1
the	1
two	1
hands	1
that	1
were	1
free	1
to	1
shake	1
hands	1
with	1
her	1
	1
alice	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
shaking	1
hands	1
with	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
first	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
hurting	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
s	1
feelings	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
best	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
difficulty	1
she	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
both	1
hands	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
they	1
were	1
dancing	1
round	1
in	1
a	1
ring	1
this	1
seemed	1
quite	1
natural	1
she	1
remembered	1
afterwards	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
music	1
playing	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
tree	1
under	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
dancing	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
done	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
it	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
branches	1
rubbing	1
one	1
across	1
the	1
other	1
like	1
fiddles	1
and	1
fiddle	1
sticks	1
	1
but	1
it	1
certainly	1
_was_	1
funny	1
alice	1
said	1
afterwards	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
telling	1
her	1
sister	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
find	1
myself	1
singing	1

i	1
don	1
t	1
know	1
when	1
i	1
began	1
it	1
but	1
somehow	1
i	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
i	1
d	1
been	1
singing	1
it	1
a	1
long	1
long	1
time	1
	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
dancers	1
were	1
fat	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
four	1
times	1
round	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
one	1
dance	1
tweedledum	1
panted	1
out	1
and	1
they	1
left	1
off	1
dancing	1
as	1
suddenly	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
begun	1
the	1
music	1
stopped	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
	1
then	1
they	1
let	1
go	1
of	1
alice	1
s	1
hands	1
and	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rather	1
awkward	1
pause	1
as	1
alice	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
begin	1
a	1
conversation	1
with	1
people	1
she	1
had	1
just	1
been	1
dancing	1
with	1
it	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
to	1
say	1
how	1
d	1
ye	1
do	1
_now_	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
we	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
got	1
beyond	1
that	1
somehow	1
	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
re	1
not	1
much	1
tired	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
	1
nohow	1
and	1
thank	1
you	1
_very_	1
much	1
for	1
asking	1

tweedledum	1
	1
so	1
_much_	1
obliged	1
added	1
tweedledee	1
you	1

poetry	1
	1
ye	1

alice	1
said	1
doubtfully	1
would	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
which	1
road	1
leads	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
	1
what	1
shall	1
i	1
repeat	1
to	1
her	1
said	1
tweedledee	1
looking	1
round	1
at	1
tweedledum	1
with	1
great	1
solemn	1
eyes	1
and	1
not	1
noticing	1
alice	1
s	1
question	1
	1
_the	1
walrus	1
and	1
the	1
carpenter_	1
is	1
the	1
longest	1
tweedledum	1
replied	1
giving	1
his	1
brother	1
an	1
affectionate	1
hug	1
	1
tweedledee	1
began	1
instantly	1
	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
shining	1
	1
	1
here	1
alice	1
ventured	1
to	1
interrupt	1
him	1
if	1
it	1
s	1
_very_	1
long	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
politely	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
would	1
you	1
please	1
tell	1
me	1
first	1
which	1
road	1
	1
tweedledee	1
smiled	1
gently	1
and	1
began	1
again	1
	1
the	1
sun	1
was	1
shining	1
on	1
the	1
sea	1
shining	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
he	1
did	1
his	1
very	1
best	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
billows	1
smooth	1
and	1
bright	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
odd	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
	1
the	1
moon	1
was	1
shining	1
sulkily	1
because	1
she	1
thought	1
the	1
sun	1
had	1
got	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
after	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
done	1
it	1
s	1
very	1
rude	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
spoil	1
the	1
fun	1
	1
the	1
sea	1
was	1
wet	1
as	1
wet	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
sands	1
were	1
dry	1
as	1
dry	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
a	1
cloud	1
because	1
no	1
cloud	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
no	1
birds	1
were	1
flying	1
over	1
head	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
birds	1
to	1
fly	1
	1
the	1
walrus	1
and	1
the	1
carpenter	1
were	1
walking	1
close	1
at	1
hand	1
they	1
wept	1
like	1
anything	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
quantities	1
of	1
sand	1
if	1
this	1
were	1
only	1
cleared	1
away	1
they	1
said	1
it	1
_would_	1
be	1
grand	1
	1
if	1
seven	1
maids	1
with	1
seven	1
mops	1
swept	1
it	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
year	1
do	1
you	1
suppose	1
the	1
walrus	1
said	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
get	1
it	1
clear	1
i	1
doubt	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter	1
and	1
shed	1
a	1
bitter	1
tear	1
	1
o	1
oysters	1
come	1
and	1
walk	1
with	1
us	1
the	1
walrus	1
did	1
beseech	1
a	1
pleasant	1
walk	1
a	1
pleasant	1
talk	1
along	1
the	1
briny	1
beach	1
we	1
cannot	1
do	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
hand	1
to	1
each	1
	1
the	1
eldest	1
oyster	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
but	1
never	1
a	1
word	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
eldest	1
oyster	1
winked	1
his	1
eye	1
and	1
shook	1
his	1
heavy	1
head	1
meaning	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
oyster	1
bed	1
	1
but	1
four	1
young	1
oysters	1
hurried	1
up	1
all	1
eager	1
for	1
the	1
treat	1
their	1
coats	1
were	1
brushed	1
their	1
faces	1
washed	1
their	1
shoes	1
were	1
clean	1
and	1
neat	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
odd	1
because	1
you	1
know	1
they	1
hadn	1
t	1
any	1
feet	1
	1
four	1
other	1
oysters	1
followed	1
them	1
and	1
yet	1
another	1
four	1
and	1
thick	1
and	1
fast	1
they	1
came	1
at	1
last	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
all	1
hopping	1
through	1
the	1
frothy	1
waves	1
and	1
scrambling	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
	1
the	1
walrus	1
and	1
the	1
carpenter	1
walked	1
on	1
a	1
mile	1
or	1
so	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
rested	1
on	1
a	1
rock	1
conveniently	1
low	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
little	1
oysters	1
stood	1
and	1
waited	1
in	1
a	1
row	1
	1
the	1
time	1
has	1
come	1
the	1
walrus	1
said	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
many	1
things	1
of	1
shoes	1
and	1
ships	1
and	1
sealing	1
wax	1
of	1
cabbages	1
and	1
kings	1
and	1
why	1
the	1
sea	1
is	1
boiling	1
hot	1
and	1
whether	1
pigs	1
have	1
wings	1
	1
but	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
the	1
oysters	1
cried	1
before	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
chat	1
for	1
some	1
of	1
us	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
are	1
fat	1
no	1
hurry	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter	1
they	1
thanked	1
him	1
much	1
for	1
that	1
	1
a	1
loaf	1
of	1
bread	1
the	1
walrus	1
said	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
chiefly	1
need	1
pepper	1
and	1
vinegar	1
besides	1
are	1
very	1
good	1
indeed	1
now	1
if	1
you	1
re	1
ready	1
oysters	1
dear	1
we	1
can	1
begin	1
to	1
feed	1
	1
but	1
not	1
on	1
us	1
the	1
oysters	1
cried	1
turning	1
a	1
little	1
blue	1
after	1
such	1
kindness	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
dismal	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
night	1
is	1
fine	1
the	1
walrus	1
said	1
do	1
you	1
admire	1
the	1
view	1
	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
kind	1
of	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
nice	1
the	1
carpenter	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
cut	1
us	1
another	1
slice	1
i	1
wish	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
quite	1
so	1
deaf	1
i	1
ve	1
had	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
twice	1
	1
it	1
seems	1
a	1
shame	1
the	1
walrus	1
said	1
to	1
play	1
them	1
such	1
a	1
trick	1
after	1
we	1
ve	1
brought	1
them	1
out	1
so	1
far	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
trot	1
so	1
quick	1
the	1
carpenter	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
butter	1
s	1
spread	1
too	1
thick	1
	1
i	1
weep	1
for	1
you	1
the	1
walrus	1
said	1
i	1
deeply	1
sympathize	1
with	1
sobs	1
and	1
tears	1
he	1
sorted	1
out	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
size	1
holding	1
his	1
pocket	1
handkerchief	1
before	1
his	1
streaming	1
eyes	1
	1
o	1
oysters	1
said	1
the	1
carpenter	1
you	1
ve	1
had	1
a	1
pleasant	1
run	1
shall	1
we	1
be	1
trotting	1
home	1
again	1
but	1
answer	1
came	1
there	1
none	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
scarcely	1
odd	1
because	1
they	1
d	1
eaten	1
every	1
one	1
	1
	1
i	1
like	1
the	1
walrus	1
best	1
said	1
alice	1
because	1
you	1
see	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
_little_	1
sorry	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
oysters	1
	1
he	1
ate	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
carpenter	1
though	1
said	1
tweedledee	1
you	1
see	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
handkerchief	1
in	1
front	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
carpenter	1
couldn	1
t	1
count	1
how	1
many	1
he	1
took	1
contrariwise	1
	1
that	1
was	1
mean	1
alice	1
said	1
indignantly	1
then	1
i	1
like	1
the	1
carpenter	1
best	1
if	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
eat	1
so	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
walrus	1
	1
but	1
he	1
ate	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
said	1
tweedledum	1
	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
puzzler	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
alice	1
began	1
well	1
they	1
were	1
_both_	1
very	1
unpleasant	1
characters	1
here	1
she	1
checked	1
herself	1
in	1
some	1
alarm	1
at	1
hearing	1
something	1
that	1
sounded	1
to	1
her	1
like	1
the	1
puffing	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
steam	1
engine	1
in	1
the	1
wood	1
near	1
them	1
though	1
she	1
feared	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
wild	1
beast	1

there	1
any	1
lions	1
or	1
tigers	1
about	1

one	1
of	1

at	1
tweedledee	1
who	1
immediately	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
hide	1
himself	1
under	1
the	1
umbrella	1
	1
alice	1
laid	1
her	1

upon	1

you	1

rose	1
to	1
a	1
perfect	1
scream	1
	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
tweedledee	1
was	1
trying	1
his	1
best	1
to	1
fold	1
up	1
the	1
umbrella	1
with	1
himself	1
in	1
it	1
which	1
was	1
such	1
an	1
extraordinary	1
thing	1
to	1
do	1
that	1
it	1
quite	1
took	1
off	1
alice	1
s	1
attention	1
from	1
the	1
angry	1
brother	1
but	1
he	1
couldn	1
t	1
quite	1
succeed	1
and	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
his	1
rolling	1
over	1
bundled	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
umbrella	1
with	1
only	1
his	1

out	1

there	1

his	1
mouth	1
and	1
his	1
large	1
eyes	1

fish	1
than	1
anything	1

	1
of	1

a	1
battle	1

said	1
in	1
a	1
calmer	1
tone	1
	1
i	1

so	1
the	1
other	1
sulkily	1
replied	1
as	1
he	1
crawled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

_she_	1
must	1
help	1
us	1
to	1
dress	1
up	1

off	1

in	1
hand	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
returned	1
in	1
a	1
minute	1
with	1
their	1
arms	1

of	1

to	1
go	1
on	1

afterwards	1
she	1

about	1

about	1

the	1
quantity	1
of	1

her	1
in	1
tying	1

fastening	1

they	1
ll	1
be	1
more	1

by	1
the	1
time	1

round	1
the	1
neck	1
of	1

to	1

alice	1

aloud	1
but	1
she	1
managed	1
to	1
turn	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
cough	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1

out	1
in	1
a	1
shrill	1
voice	1
of	1
alarm	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
brothers	1
took	1
to	1
their	1

were	1
out	1
of	1

a	1
moment	1

alice	1
ran	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
stopped	1
under	1
a	1
large	1
tree	1

can	1
never	1

at	1
me	1

again	1
	1
the	1

looked	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
helpless	1
frightened	1
sort	1
of	1
way	1
and	1
kept	1
repeating	1
something	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
to	1
herself	1
that	1
sounded	1
like	1
bread	1

butter	1
bread	1
and	1
butter	1
and	1
alice	1

an	1
argument	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
beginning	1
of	1

a	1

of	1

across	1
a	1

brook	1

the	1

ehh	1
the	1
last	1
word	1
ended	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
bleat	1
so	1
like	1
a	1
sheep	1
that	1
alice	1
quite	1
started	1
	1
she	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
queen	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
suddenly	1
wrapped	1
herself	1
up	1
in	1
wool	1
alice	1
rubbed	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
looked	1
again	1
she	1
couldn	1
t	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
at	1
all	1
was	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
shop	1
and	1
was	1
that	1
really	1
was	1
it	1
really	1
a	1
_sheep_	1
that	1
was	1
sitting	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
counter	1
rub	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
she	1
could	1
make	1
nothing	1
more	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
dark	1
shop	1
leaning	1
with	1
her	1
elbows	1
on	1
the	1
counter	1
and	1
opposite	1
to	1
her	1
was	1
an	1
old	1
sheep	1
sitting	1
in	1
an	1
arm	1
chair	1
knitting	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
leaving	1
off	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
through	1
a	1
great	1
pair	1
of	1
spectacles	1
	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
buy	1
the	1
sheep	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
looking	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
from	1
her	1
knitting	1
	1
i	1
don	1
t	1
_quite_	1
know	1
yet	1
alice	1
said	1
very	1
gently	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
look	1
all	1
round	1
me	1
first	1
if	1
i	1
might	1
	1
you	1
may	1
look	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
if	1
you	1
like	1
said	1
the	1
sheep	1
but	1
you	1
can	1
t	1
look	1
_all_	1
round	1
you	1
unless	1
you	1
ve	1
got	1
eyes	1
at	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
your	1
head	1
	1
but	1
these	1
as	1
it	1
happened	1
alice	1
had	1
_not_	1
got	1
so	1
she	1
contented	1
herself	1
with	1
turning	1
round	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
shelves	1
as	1
she	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
	1
the	1
shop	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
curious	1
things	1
but	1
the	1
oddest	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
was	1
that	1
whenever	1
she	1
looked	1
hard	1
at	1
any	1
shelf	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
exactly	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
on	1
it	1
that	1
particular	1
shelf	1
was	1
always	1
quite	1
empty	1
though	1
the	1
others	1
round	1
it	1
were	1
crowded	1
as	1
full	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
hold	1
	1
things	1
flow	1
about	1
so	1
here	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
a	1
plaintive	1
tone	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
spent	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
so	1
in	1
vainly	1
pursuing	1
a	1
large	1
bright	1
thing	1
that	1
looked	1
sometimes	1
like	1
a	1
doll	1
and	1
sometimes	1
like	1
a	1
work	1
box	1
and	1
was	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
shelf	1
next	1
above	1
the	1
one	1
she	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
and	1
this	1
one	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
provoking	1
of	1
all	1
but	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
she	1
added	1
as	1
a	1
sudden	1
thought	1
struck	1
her	1
i	1
ll	1
follow	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
top	1
shelf	1
of	1
all	1
it	1
ll	1
puzzle	1
it	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
ceiling	1
i	1
expect	1
	1
but	1
even	1
this	1
plan	1
failed	1
the	1
thing	1
went	1
through	1
the	1
ceiling	1
as	1
quietly	1
as	1
possible	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
quite	1
used	1
to	1
it	1
	1
are	1
you	1
a	1
child	1
or	1
a	1
teetotum	1
the	1
sheep	1
said	1
as	1
she	1
took	1
up	1
another	1
pair	1
of	1
needles	1
you	1
ll	1
make	1
me	1
giddy	1
soon	1
if	1
you	1
go	1
on	1
turning	1
round	1
like	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
now	1
working	1
with	1
fourteen	1
pairs	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
alice	1
couldn	1
t	1
help	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
in	1
great	1
astonishment	1
	1
how	1
_can_	1
she	1
knit	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
the	1
puzzled	1
child	1
thought	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
gets	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
porcupine	1
every	1
minute	1
	1
can	1
you	1
row	1
the	1
sheep	1
asked	1
handing	1
her	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
knitting	1
needles	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
	1
yes	1
a	1
little	1
but	1
not	1
on	1
land	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
needles	1
alice	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
suddenly	1
the	1
needles	1
turned	1
into	1
oars	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
boat	1
gliding	1
along	1
between	1
banks	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
do	1
her	1
best	1
	1
feather	1
cried	1
the	1
sheep	1
as	1
she	1
took	1
up	1
another	1
pair	1
of	1
needles	1
	1
this	1
didn	1
t	1
sound	1
like	1
a	1
remark	1
that	1
needed	1
any	1
answer	1
so	1
alice	1
said	1
nothing	1
but	1
pulled	1
away	1
there	1
was	1
something	1
very	1
queer	1
about	1
the	1
water	1
she	1
thought	1
as	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
oars	1
got	1
fast	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
would	1
hardly	1
come	1
out	1
again	1
	1
feather	1
feather	1
the	1
sheep	1
cried	1
again	1
taking	1
more	1
needles	1
you	1
ll	1
be	1
catching	1
a	1
crab	1
directly	1
	1
a	1
dear	1
little	1
crab	1
thought	1
alice	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
that	1
	1
didn	1
t	1
you	1
hear	1
me	1
say	1
feather	1
the	1
sheep	1
cried	1
angrily	1
taking	1
up	1
quite	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
needles	1
	1
indeed	1
i	1
did	1
said	1
alice	1
you	1
ve	1
said	1
it	1
very	1
often	1
and	1
very	1
loud	1
please	1
where	1
_are_	1
the	1
crabs	1
	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
course	1
said	1
the	1
sheep	1
sticking	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
needles	1
into	1
her	1
hair	1
as	1
her	1
hands	1
were	1
full	1
feather	1
i	1
say	1
	1
_why_	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
feather	1
so	1
often	1
alice	1
asked	1
at	1
last	1
rather	1
vexed	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
a	1
bird	1
	1
you	1
are	1
said	1
the	1
sheep	1
you	1
re	1
a	1
little	1
goose	1
	1
this	1
offended	1
alice	1
a	1
little	1
so	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
conversation	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
while	1
the	1
boat	1
glided	1
gently	1
on	1
sometimes	1
among	1
beds	1
of	1
weeds	1
which	1
made	1
the	1
oars	1
stick	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
worse	1
then	1
ever	1
and	1
sometimes	1
under	1
trees	1
but	1
always	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
tall	1
river	1
banks	1
frowning	1
over	1
their	1
heads	1
	1
oh	1
please	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
scented	1
rushes	1
alice	1
cried	1
in	1
a	1
sudden	1
transport	1
of	1
delight	1
there	1
really	1
are	1
and	1
_such_	1
beauties	1
	1
you	1
needn	1
t	1
say	1
please	1
to	1
_me_	1
about	1
em	1
the	1
sheep	1
said	1
without	1
looking	1
up	1
from	1
her	1
knitting	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
put	1
em	1
there	1
and	1
i	1
m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
em	1
away	1
	1
no	1
but	1
i	1
meant	1
please	1
may	1
we	1
wait	1
and	1
pick	1
some	1
alice	1
pleaded	1
if	1
you	1
don	1
t	1
mind	1
stopping	1
the	1
boat	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
	1
how	1
am	1
_i_	1
to	1
stop	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
sheep	1
if	1
you	1
leave	1
off	1
rowing	1
it	1
ll	1
stop	1
of	1
itself	1
	1
so	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
drift	1
down	1
the	1
stream	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
till	1
it	1
glided	1
gently	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
waving	1
rushes	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
little	1
sleeves	1
were	1
carefully	1
rolled	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
arms	1
were	1
plunged	1
in	1
elbow	1
deep	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
rushes	1
a	1
good	1
long	1
way	1
down	1
before	1
breaking	1
them	1
off	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
alice	1
forgot	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
sheep	1
and	1
the	1
knitting	1
as	1
she	1
bent	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
with	1
just	1
the	1
ends	1
of	1
her	1
tangled	1
hair	1
dipping	1
into	1
the	1
water	1
while	1
with	1
bright	1
eager	1
eyes	1
she	1
caught	1
at	1
one	1
bunch	1
after	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
darling	1
scented	1
rushes	1
	1
i	1
only	1
hope	1
the	1
boat	1
won	1
t	1
tipple	1
over	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
oh	1
_what_	1
a	1
lovely	1
one	1
only	1
i	1
couldn	1
t	1
quite	1
reach	1
it	1
and	1
it	1
certainly	1
_did_	1
seem	1
a	1
little	1
provoking	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
happened	1
on	1
purpose	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
though	1
she	1
managed	1
to	1
pick	1
plenty	1
of	1
beautiful	1
rushes	1
as	1
the	1
boat	1
glided	1
by	1
there	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
more	1
lovely	1
one	1
that	1
she	1
couldn	1
t	1
reach	1
	1
the	1
prettiest	1
are	1
always	1
further	1
she	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
with	1
a	1
sigh	1
at	1
the	1
obstinacy	1
of	1
the	1
rushes	1
in	1
growing	1
so	1
far	1
off	1
as	1
with	1
flushed	1
cheeks	1
and	1
dripping	1
hair	1
and	1
hands	1
she	1
scrambled	1
back	1
into	1
her	1
place	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
arrange	1
her	1
new	1
found	1
treasures	1
	1
what	1
mattered	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
just	1
then	1
that	1
the	1
rushes	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
fade	1
and	1
to	1
lose	1
all	1
their	1
scent	1
and	1
beauty	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
moment	1
that	1
she	1
picked	1
them	1
even	1
real	1
scented	1
rushes	1
you	1
know	1
last	1
only	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
while	1
and	1
these	1
being	1
dream	1
rushes	1
melted	1
away	1
almost	1
like	1
snow	1
as	1
they	1
lay	1
in	1
heaps	1
at	1
her	1
feet	1
but	1
alice	1
hardly	1
noticed	1
this	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
other	1
curious	1
things	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
	1
they	1
hadn	1
t	1
gone	1
much	1
farther	1
before	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
oars	1
got	1
fast	1
in	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
_wouldn	1
t_	1
come	1
out	1
again	1
so	1
alice	1
explained	1
it	1
afterwards	1
and	1
the	1
consequence	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
handle	1
of	1
it	1
caught	1
her	1
under	1
the	1
chin	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
little	1
shrieks	1
of	1
oh	1
oh	1
oh	1
from	1
poor	1
alice	1
it	1
swept	1
her	1
straight	1
off	1
the	1
seat	1
and	1
down	1
among	1
the	1
heap	1
of	1
rushes	1
	1
however	1
she	1
wasn	1
t	1
hurt	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
up	1
again	1
the	1
sheep	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
her	1
knitting	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
nice	1
crab	1
you	1
caught	1
she	1
remarked	1
as	1
alice	1
got	1
back	1
into	1
her	1
place	1
very	1
much	1
relieved	1
to	1
find	1
herself	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
	1
was	1
it	1
i	1
didn	1
t	1
see	1
it	1
said	1
alice	1
peeping	1
cautiously	1
over	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
into	1
the	1
dark	1
water	1
i	1
wish	1
it	1
hadn	1
t	1
let	1
go	1
i	1
should	1
so	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
little	1
crab	1
to	1
take	1
home	1
with	1
me	1
but	1
the	1
sheep	1
only	1
laughed	1
scornfully	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
her	1
knitting	1
	1
are	1
there	1
many	1
crabs	1
here	1
said	1
alice	1
	1
crabs	1
and	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things	1
said	1
the	1
sheep	1
plenty	1
of	1
choice	1
only	1
make	1
up	1
your	1
mind	1
now	1
what	1
_do_	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
buy	1
	1

buy	1
alice	1
echoed	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
that	1
was	1
half	1
astonished	1
and	1
half	1
frightened	1
for	1
the	1
oars	1
and	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
the	1
river	1
had	1
vanished	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
back	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
dark	1
shop	1
	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
buy	1
an	1
egg	1
please	1
she	1
said	1
timidly	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
sell	1
them	1
	1
fivepence	1
farthing	1
for	1
one	1
twopence	1
for	1
two	1
the	1
sheep	1
replied	1
	1
then	1
two	1
are	1
cheaper	1
than	1
one	1
alice	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
surprised	1
tone	1
taking	1
out	1
her	1
purse	1
	1
only	1
you	1
_must_	1
eat	1
them	1
both	1
if	1
you	1
buy	1
two	1
said	1
the	1
sheep	1
	1
then	1
i	1
ll	1
have	1
_one_	1
please	1
said	1
alice	1
as	1
she	1
put	1
the	1
money	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
counter	1
for	1
she	1
thought	1
to	1
herself	1
they	1
mightn	1
t	1
be	1
at	1
all	1
nice	1
you	1
know	1
	1
the	1
sheep	1
took	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
away	1
in	1
a	1
box	1
then	1
she	1
said	1
i	1
never	1
put	1
things	1
into	1
people	1
s	1
hands	1
that	1
would	1
never	1
do	1
you	1
must	1
get	1
it	1
for	1
yourself	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
she	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
shop	1
and	1
set	1
the	1
egg	1
upright	1
on	1
a	1
shelf	1
	1
i	1
wonder	1
_why_	1
it	1
wouldn	1
t	1
do	1
thought	1
alice	1
as	1
she	1
groped	1
her	1
way	1
among	1
the	1
tables	1
and	1
chairs	1
for	1
the	1
shop	1
was	1
very	1
dark	1
towards	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
egg	1
seems	1
to	1
get	1
further	1
away	1
the	1
more	1
i	1
walk	1
towards	1
it	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
is	1
this	1
a	1
chair	1
why	1
it	1
s	1
got	1
branches	1
i	1
declare	1
how	1
very	1
odd	1
to	1
find	1
trees	1
growing	1
here	1
and	1
actually	1
here	1
s	1
a	1
little	1
brook	1
well	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
queerest	1
shop	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
wondering	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
as	1
everything	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
tree	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
she	1
quite	1
expected	1
the	1
egg	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
chapter	1
vi	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
	1
	1
however	1
the	1
egg	1
only	1
got	1
larger	1
and	1
larger	1
and	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
human	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
within	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
of	1
it	1
she	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
nose	1
and	1
mouth	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
come	1
close	1
to	1
it	1
she	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
himself	1
it	1
can	1
t	1
be	1
anybody	1
else	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
i	1
m	1
as	1
certain	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
name	1
were	1
written	1
all	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
easily	1
on	1
that	1
enormous	1
face	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
was	1
sitting	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
crossed	1
like	1
a	1
turk	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
high	1
wall	1
such	1
a	1
narrow	1
one	1
that	1
alice	1
quite	1
wondered	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
keep	1
his	1
balance	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
steadily	1
fixed	1
in	1
the	1
opposite	1
direction	1
and	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
take	1
the	1
least	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
she	1
thought	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
stuffed	1
figure	1
after	1
all	1
	1
and	1
how	1
exactly	1
like	1
an	1
egg	1
he	1
is	1
she	1
said	1
aloud	1
standing	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
ready	1
to	1
catch	1
him	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
every	1
moment	1
expecting	1
him	1
to	1
fall	1
	1
it	1
s	1
_very_	1
provoking	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
said	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
silence	1
looking	1
away	1
from	1
alice	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
egg	1
_very	1
_	1
	1
i	1
said	1
you	1
_looked_	1
like	1
an	1
egg	1
sir	1
alice	1
gently	1
explained	1
and	1
some	1
eggs	1
are	1
very	1
pretty	1
you	1
know	1
she	1
added	1
hoping	1
to	1
turn	1
her	1
remark	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
compliment	1
	1
some	1
people	1
said	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
looking	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
as	1
usual	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
sense	1
than	1
a	1
baby	1
	1
alice	1
didn	1
t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
it	1
wasn	1
t	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
conversation	1
she	1
thought	1
as	1
he	1
never	1
said	1
anything	1
to	1
_her_	1
in	1
fact	1
his	1
last	1
remark	1
was	1
evidently	1
addressed	1
to	1
a	1
tree	1
so	1
she	1
stood	1
and	1
softly	1
repeated	1
to	1
herself	1
	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
sat	1
on	1
a	1
wall	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
fall	1
all	1
the	1
king	1
s	1
horses	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
king	1

couldn	1
t	1
put	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
in	1
his	1
place	1
again	1
	1
	1
that	1
last	1
line	1
is	1
much	1
too	1
long	1
for	1
the	1
poetry	1
she	1
added	1
almost	1
out	1
loud	1
forgetting	1
that	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
would	1
hear	1
her	1
	1
don	1
t	1
stand	1
there	1
chattering	1
to	1
yourself	1
like	1
that	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
said	1
looking	1
at	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
but	1
tell	1
me	1
your	1

and	1
your	1

	1
my	1

	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
stupid	1
enough	1
name	1

dumpty	1
interrupted	1
impatiently	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
	1
_must_	1
a	1

doubtfully	1
	1
of	1
course	1

with	1
a	1
short	1
laugh	1

out	1

went	1
on	1
not	1
with	1
any	1
idea	1
of	1
making	1
another	1
riddle	1
but	1
simply	1
in	1
her	1

natured	1
anxiety	1
for	1
the	1
queer	1
creature	1

pursed	1
his	1

looked	1
so	1
solemn	1

grand	1
that	1
alice	1

hardly	1
help	1
laughing	1
_if_	1

in	1
a	1

he	1
grinned	1
almost	1
from	1
ear	1
to	1
ear	1
as	1
he	1
leant	1
forwards	1

as	1

off	1

sort	1
of	1

had	1
had	1
quite	1
enough	1
of	1
the	1

of	1

in	1
dismay	1
for	1

	1
evidently	1
humpty	1

was	1
very	1
angry	1

said	1
nothing	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
or	1
two	1
when	1

_did_	1
speak	1
again	1

in	1
a	1
deep	1
growl	1
	1

is	1
a	1
_most	1
provoking_	1
thing	1

at	1

	1
i	1

a	1
kettle	1
large	1

for	1
the	1

bed	1
	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
i	1
said	1
it	1
plain	1
then	1
you	1
must	1
wake	1
them	1
up	1
again	1
	1
i	1
said	1
it	1
very	1
loud	1
and	1
clear	1
i	1
went	1
and	1
shouted	1
in	1
his	1
ear	1
	1
	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
raised	1
his	1
voice	1
almost	1
to	1
a	1
scream	1
as	1
he	1
repeated	1
this	1
verse	1
and	1
alice	1
thought	1
with	1
a	1
shudder	1
i	1
wouldn	1
t	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
messenger	1
for	1
_anything_	1
	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
stiff	1
and	1
proud	1
he	1
said	1
you	1
needn	1
t	1
shout	1
so	1
loud	1
	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
proud	1
and	1
stiff	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
d	1
go	1
and	1
wake	1
them	1
if	1
	1
i	1
took	1
a	1
corkscrew	1
from	1
the	1
shelf	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
wake	1
them	1
up	1
myself	1
	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
found	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
locked	1
i	1
pulled	1
and	1
pushed	1
and	1
kicked	1
and	1
knocked	1
	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
found	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
shut	1
i	1
tried	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
handle	1
but	1
	1
	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
pause	1
	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
alice	1
timidly	1
asked	1
	1
that	1
s	1
all	1
said	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
good	1
bye	1
	1
this	1
was	1
rather	1
sudden	1
alice	1
thought	1
but	1
after	1
such	1
a	1
_very_	1
strong	1
hint	1
that	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
going	1
she	1
felt	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
hardly	1
be	1
civil	1
to	1
stay	1
so	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
held	1
out	1
her	1
hand	1
good	1
bye	1
till	1
we	1
meet	1
again	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
cheerfully	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
	1
i	1
shouldn	1

know	1
you	1
again	1
if	1

_did_	1
meet	1

dumpty	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
discontented	1
tone	1
giving	1
her	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
fingers	1
to	1
shake	1
you	1
re	1
so	1
exactly	1
like	1
other	1
people	1
	1
the	1
face	1
is	1
what	1
one	1
goes	1
by	1
generally	1
alice	1
remarked	1
in	1
a	1
thoughtful	1
tone	1
	1
that	1
s	1
just	1
what	1
i	1
complain	1
of	1
said	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
your	1
face	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
everybody	1
has	1
the	1
two	1
eyes	1
so	1
marking	1
their	1
places	1
in	1
the	1

with	1
this	1
thumb	1
nose	1
in	1

always	1

eyes	1
on	1
the	1

side	1
of	1
the	1

the	1

at	1
the	1

be	1
_some_	1
help	1
	1
it	1
wouldn	1
t	1
look	1
nice	1
alice	1
objected	1
but	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
only	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
said	1
wait	1
till	1
you	1
ve	1
tried	1
	1
alice	1
waited	1
a	1
minute	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
speak	1
again	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
never	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
or	1
took	1
any	1
further	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
she	1
said	1
good	1
bye	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
getting	1
no	1
answer	1
to	1
this	1
she	1
quietly	1
walked	1
away	1
but	1
she	1
couldn	1
t	1
help	1
saying	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
went	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
unsatisfactory	1
she	1
repeated	1
this	1
aloud	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
comfort	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
long	1
word	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
unsatisfactory	1
people	1
i	1
_ever_	1
met	1

never	1
finished	1
the	1
sentence	1
for	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
a	1
heavy	1
crash	1
shook	1

next	1
moment	1
soldiers	1
came	1
running	1
through	1
the	1
wood	1
at	1
first	1
in	1
twos	1
and	1
threes	1
then	1
ten	1
or	1
twenty	1
together	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
in	1
such	1
crowds	1
that	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
whole	1
forest	1
alice	1
got	1
behind	1
a	1
tree	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
run	1
over	1
and	1
watched	1
them	1
go	1
by	1
	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
soldiers	1
so	1
uncertain	1
on	1
their	1
feet	1
they	1
were	1
always	1
tripping	1
over	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
and	1
whenever	1
one	1
went	1
down	1
several	1
more	1
always	1
fell	1
over	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
ground	1
was	1
soon	1
covered	1
with	1
little	1
heaps	1
of	1
men	1
	1
then	1
came	1
the	1
horses	1
having	1
four	1
feet	1
these	1
managed	1
rather	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
foot	1
soldiers	1
but	1
even	1
_they_	1
stumbled	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
regular	1
rule	1
that	1
whenever	1
a	1
horse	1
stumbled	1
the	1
rider	1
fell	1
off	1
instantly	1
the	1
confusion	1
got	1
worse	1
every	1
moment	1
and	1
alice	1
was	1
very	1
glad	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
into	1
an	1
open	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
found	1
the	1
white	1
king	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
busily	1
writing	1
in	1

at	1

speaking	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1

at	1

down	1

slyly	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
crown	1

the	1
poor	1
king	1
was	1
nearly	1
shaking	1
off	1

trembled	1
so	1
much	1
	1

up	1

interrupted	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
quarrel	1
going	1
on	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
nervous	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
quite	1
quivered	1
all	1
round	1

a	1
little	1
brook	1
with	1
the	1

away	1
diligently	1
with	1

very	1
provoking	1

to	1
the	1

getting	1
quite	1
used	1

i	1
ve	1
cut	1
several	1

it	1
round	1
first	1
and	1
cut	1
it	1
afterwards	1
	1

sounded	1
nonsense	1

alice	1
very	1
obediently	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
carried	1
the	1

round	1

divided	1
itself	1
into	1
three	1

did	1
so	1
_now_	1
cut	1

up	1

alice	1
sat	1
with	1
the	1
knife	1
in	1
her	1

through	1
her	1

were	1
interrupted	1
by	1
a	1
loud	1
shouting	1
of	1
ahoy	1
ahoy	1
check	1
and	1
a	1
knight	1
dressed	1
in	1
crimson	1
armour	1
came	1
galloping	1
down	1
upon	1
her	1
brandishing	1
a	1
great	1
club	1
just	1
as	1

cried	1

tumbled	1
off	1

	1
startled	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
alice	1
was	1
more	1
frightened	1
for	1
him	1
than	1
for	1
herself	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
and	1
watched	1
him	1
with	1
some	1
anxiety	1
as	1
he	1
mounted	1
again	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
comfortably	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
he	1
began	1
once	1
more	1
you	1
re	1
my	1
but	1
here	1
another	1
voice	1
broke	1
in	1
ahoy	1
ahoy	1
check	1
and	1
alice	1
looked	1
round	1
in	1
some	1
surprise	1
for	1
the	1
new	1
enemy	1
	1
this	1
time	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
white	1
knight	1
he	1
drew	1
up	1
at	1
alice	1
s	1
side	1
and	1
tumbled	1
off	1
his	1
horse	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
red	1
knight	1
had	1
done	1
then	1
he	1
got	1
on	1
again	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
knights	1
sat	1
and	1
looked	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
without	1
speaking	1
alice	1
looked	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
some	1
bewilderment	1
	1
she	1
s	1
_my_	1
prisoner	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
red	1
knight	1
said	1
at	1
last	1
	1
yes	1
but	1
then	1
_i_	1
came	1
and	1
rescued	1
her	1
the	1
white	1
knight	1
replied	1
	1
well	1
we	1
must	1
fight	1
for	1
her	1
then	1
said	1
the	1
red	1
knight	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
helmet	1
which	1
hung	1
from	1
the	1
saddle	1
and	1
was	1
something	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
a	1
horse	1
s	1
head	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
	1
you	1
will	1
observe	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
battle	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
white	1
knight	1
remarked	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
helmet	1
too	1
	1
i	1
always	1
do	1
said	1
the	1
red	1
knight	1
and	1
they	1
began	1
banging	1
away	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
with	1
such	1
fury	1
that	1
alice	1
got	1
behind	1
a	1
tree	1
to	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
blows	1
	1
i	1
wonder	1
now	1
what	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
battle	1
are	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
the	1
fight	1
timidly	1
peeping	1
out	1
from	1
her	1
hiding	1
place	1
one	1
rule	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
if	1
one	1
knight	1
hits	1
the	1
other	1
he	1
knocks	1
him	1
off	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
misses	1
he	1
tumbles	1
off	1
himself	1
and	1
another	1
rule	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
hold	1
their	1
clubs	1
with	1
their	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
punch	1
and	1
judy	1
what	1
a	1
noise	1
they	1
make	1
when	1
they	1
tumble	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
whole	1
set	1
of	1
fire	1
irons	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
fender	1
and	1
how	1
quiet	1
the	1
horses	1
are	1
they	1
let	1
them	1
get	1
on	1
and	1
off	1
them	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
tables	1
	1
another	1
rule	1
of	1
battle	1
that	1
alice	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
always	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
ended	1
with	1
their	1
both	1
falling	1
off	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
when	1
they	1
got	1
up	1
again	1
they	1
shook	1
hands	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
red	1
knight	1
mounted	1
and	1
galloped	1
off	1
	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
glorious	1
victory	1
wasn	1
t	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
white	1
knight	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
panting	1
	1
i	1

safe	1
to	1
the	1

alice	1
may	1
i	1
help	1
you	1
off	1
with	1
your	1
helmet	1
it	1
was	1
evidently	1
more	1
than	1
he	1
could	1
manage	1
by	1
himself	1
however	1
she	1
managed	1
to	1
shake	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
last	1
	1
now	1

the	1
knight	1
putting	1
back	1
his	1
shaggy	1
hair	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
gentle	1
face	1
and	1
large	1
mild	1
eyes	1
to	1
alice	1
she	1
thought	1
she	1

never	1

such	1
a	1
strange	1
looking	1
soldier	1
in	1
all	1
her	1
life	1
	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
tin	1
armour	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
fit	1
him	1
very	1
badly	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
queer	1
shaped	1
little	1
deal	1
box	1
fastened	1
across	1
his	1
shoulder	1
upside	1
down	1

with	1
the	1
lid	1
hanging	1
open	1

with	1
great	1
curiosity	1

i	1

you	1
re	1
admiring	1
my	1

the	1

_out_	1

knight	1
said	1
a	1
shade	1
of	1
vexation	1
passing	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
must	1
have	1
fallen	1
out	1
and	1
the	1
box	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
without	1
them	1
he	1
unfastened	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
throw	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
bushes	1
when	1
a	1
sudden	1
thought	1
seemed	1
to	1
strike	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
hung	1
it	1
carefully	1
on	1
a	1
tree	1
can	1
you	1
guess	1
why	1
i	1
did	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
alice	1
	1
alice	1
shook	1
her	1
head	1
	1
in	1
hopes	1
some	1
bees	1
may	1
make	1
a	1
nest	1
in	1
it	1
then	1
i	1
should	1
get	1
the	1
honey	1
	1

you	1

bee	1

something	1

one	1
fastened	1
to	1
the	1

alice	1
	1
yes	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
bee	1
hive	1
the	1
knight	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
discontented	1
tone	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
kind	1
but	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
bee	1
has	1
come	1
near	1
it	1
yet	1
and	1
the	1

thing	1
is	1
a	1
mouse	1
trap	1
i	1
suppose	1
the	1

	1

the	1
mouse	1

was	1
for	1

horse	1
s	1
back	1
	1
not	1
very	1

if	1

_do_	1

on	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
it	1
s	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
be	1

for	1
_everything_	1
that	1

the	1

all	1
those	1
anklets	1
round	1
his	1
feet	1
	1

what	1
are	1
they	1
for	1
alice	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
great	1
curiosity	1
	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
the	1
bites	1
of	1
sharks	1
the	1
knight	1
replied	1
it	1
s	1
an	1
invention	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
and	1
now	1
help	1

on	1
i	1

the	1
dish	1
for	1
	1

meant	1
for	1
plum	1
cake	1

alice	1
	1
we	1
d	1
better	1
take	1
it	1
with	1
us	1
the	1
knight	1
said	1
it	1
ll	1
come	1
in	1
handy	1
if	1
we	1
find	1
any	1
plum	1
cake	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
it	1
into	1
this	1
bag	1
	1
this	1
took	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
time	1
to	1
manage	1
though	1
alice	1
held	1
the	1
bag	1
open	1
very	1
carefully	1
because	1
the	1
knight	1
was	1
so	1
_very_	1
awkward	1
in	1
putting	1
in	1
the	1
dish	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
that	1
he	1
tried	1
he	1
fell	1
in	1
himself	1
instead	1
it	1
s	1
rather	1
a	1
tight	1
fit	1
you	1
see	1
he	1
said	1
as	1
they	1
got	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
last	1
there	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
candlesticks	1
in	1
the	1
bag	1
and	1
he	1
hung	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
saddle	1
which	1
was	1
already	1
loaded	1
with	1
bunches	1
of	1
carrots	1
and	1
fire	1
irons	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
	1
i	1
hope	1
you	1
ve	1
got	1
your	1
hair	1
well	1
fastened	1
on	1
he	1
continued	1
as	1
they	1
set	1
off	1
	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
usual	1
way	1
alice	1
said	1
smiling	1
	1
that	1
s	1
hardly	1
enough	1
he	1
said	1
anxiously	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
so	1
_very_	1
strong	1
here	1
it	1
s	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
soup	1
	1
have	1
you	1
invented	1
a	1
plan	1
for	1
keeping	1
the	1
hair	1
from	1
being	1
blown	1
off	1
alice	1
enquired	1
	1
not	1
yet	1
said	1
the	1
knight	1
but	1
i	1
ve	1
got	1
a	1
plan	1
for	1
keeping	1
it	1
from	1
_falling_	1
off	1
	1
i	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
very	1
much	1
	1
first	1
you	1
take	1
an	1
upright	1
stick	1
said	1
the	1
knight	1
then	1
you	1
make	1
your	1
hair	1
creep	1
up	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
fruit	1
tree	1
now	1
the	1
reason	1
hair	1
falls	1
off	1
is	1
because	1
it	1
hangs	1
_down_	1
things	1
never	1
fall	1
_upwards_	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
plan	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
invention	1
you	1

	1

sound	1
a	1
comfortable	1
plan	1
alice	1
thought	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
minutes	1
she	1
walked	1
on	1
in	1
silence	1
puzzling	1
over	1
the	1
idea	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
stopping	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
poor	1
knight	1
who	1
certainly	1
was	1
_not_	1
a	1
good	1
rider	1
	1
whenever	1
the	1
horse	1
stopped	1
which	1
it	1
did	1
very	1
often	1
he	1
fell	1
off	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
whenever	1
it	1
went	1
on	1
again	1
which	1
it	1
generally	1
did	1
rather	1
suddenly	1
he	1
fell	1
off	1
behind	1
otherwise	1
he	1
kept	1
on	1
pretty	1
well	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
habit	1
of	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
falling	1
off	1
sideways	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
generally	1
did	1
this	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
on	1
which	1
alice	1
was	1
walking	1
she	1
soon	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
plan	1
not	1
to	1
walk	1
_quite_	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
horse	1
	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
you	1
ve	1
not	1
had	1
much	1
practice	1
in	1
riding	1
she	1
ventured	1
to	1
say	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
helping	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
fifth	1
tumble	1
	1
the	1
knight	1
looked	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
offended	1
at	1
the	1
remark	1
what	1
makes	1
you	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
asked	1
as	1
he	1
scrambled	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
saddle	1
keeping	1
hold	1
of	1
alice	1
s	1
hair	1
with	1
one	1
hand	1
to	1
save	1
himself	1
from	1
falling	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
	1
because	1
people	1
don	1
t	1
fall	1
off	1
quite	1
so	1
often	1
when	1
they	1
ve	1
had	1
much	1
practice	1
	1
i	1
ve	1
had	1
plenty	1
of	1
practice	1
the	1
knight	1
said	1
very	1
gravely	1
plenty	1
of	1
practice	1
	1
alice	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
nothing	1
better	1
to	1
say	1
than	1
indeed	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
as	1
heartily	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
in	1
silence	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
knight	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut	1
muttering	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
alice	1
watching	1
anxiously	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
tumble	1
	1
the	1
great	1
art	1
of	1
riding	1
the	1
knight	1
suddenly	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
waving	1
his	1
right	1
arm	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
here	1
the	1
sentence	1
ended	1
as	1
suddenly	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
begun	1
as	1
the	1
knight	1
fell	1
heavily	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
exactly	1
in	1
the	1
path	1
where	1
alice	1
was	1
walking	1
she	1
was	1
quite	1
frightened	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
anxious	1
tone	1
as	1
she	1
picked	1
him	1
up	1
i	1
hope	1
no	1
bones	1
are	1
broken	1
	1
none	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
knight	1
said	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
didn	1
t	1
mind	1
breaking	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
the	1
great	1
art	1
of	1
riding	1
as	1
i	1
was	1
saying	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
your	1
balance	1
properly	1
like	1
this	1
you	1
know	1
	1
he	1
let	1
go	1
the	1
bridle	1
and	1
stretched	1
out	1
both	1
his	1
arms	1
to	1
show	1
alice	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
and	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
fell	1
flat	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
right	1
under	1
the	1
horse	1
s	1
feet	1
	1
plenty	1
of	1
practice	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
repeating	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
alice	1
was	1
getting	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
feet	1
again	1
plenty	1
of	1
practice	1
	1
it	1
s	1
too	1
ridiculous	1
cried	1
alice	1
losing	1
all	1
her	1
patience	1
this	1
time	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
wooden	1
horse	1
on	1
wheels	1
that	1
you	1
ought	1
	1
does	1
that	1
kind	1
go	1
smoothly	1
the	1
knight	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
great	1
interest	1
clasping	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
the	1
horse	1
s	1
neck	1
as	1
he	1
spoke	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
save	1
himself	1
from	1
tumbling	1
off	1
again	1
	1
much	1
more	1
smoothly	1
than	1
a	1
live	1
horse	1
alice	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
scream	1
of	1
laughter	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
do	1
to	1
prevent	1
it	1
	1
i	1
ll	1
get	1
one	1
the	1
knight	1
said	1
thoughtfully	1
to	1
himself	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
several	1
	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
short	1
silence	1
after	1
this	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
knight	1
went	1
on	1
again	1
i	1
m	1
a	1
great	1
hand	1
at	1
inventing	1
things	1
now	1
i	1
daresay	1
you	1
noticed	1
that	1
last	1
time	1
you	1
picked	1
me	1
up	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
looking	1
rather	1
thoughtful	1
	1
you	1
_were_	1
a	1
little	1
grave	1
said	1
alice	1
	1
well	1
just	1
then	1
i	1
was	1
inventing	1
a	1
new	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
over	1
a	1
gate	1
would	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
	1
very	1
much	1
indeed	1
alice	1
said	1
politely	1
	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
i	1
came	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it	1
said	1
the	1
knight	1
you	1
see	1
i	1
said	1
to	1
myself	1
the	1
only	1
difficulty	1
is	1
with	1
the	1
feet	1
the	1
_head_	1
is	1
high	1
enough	1
already	1
now	1
first	1
i	1
put	1
my	1
head	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
then	1
i	1
stand	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
then	1
the	1
feet	1
are	1
high	1
enough	1
you	1
see	1
then	1
i	1
m	1
over	1
you	1
see	1
	1
yes	1
i	1
suppose	1
you	1
d	1
be	1
over	1
when	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
alice	1
said	1
thoughtfully	1
but	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
rather	1
hard	1
	1
i	1
haven	1
t	1
tried	1
it	1
yet	1
the	1
knight	1
said	1
gravely	1
so	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
tell	1
for	1
certain	1
but	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
it	1
_would_	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
hard	1
	1
he	1
looked	1
so	1
vexed	1
at	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
alice	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
hastily	1
what	1
a	1
curious	1
helmet	1
you	1
ve	1
got	1
she	1
said	1
cheerfully	1
is	1
that	1
your	1
invention	1
too	1
	1
the	1
knight	1
looked	1
down	1
proudly	1
at	1
his	1
helmet	1
which	1
hung	1
from	1
the	1
saddle	1
yes	1
he	1
said	1
but	1
i	1
ve	1
invented	1
a	1
better	1
one	1
than	1
that	1
like	1
a	1
sugar	1
loaf	1
when	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
wear	1
it	1
if	1
i	1
fell	1
off	1
the	1
horse	1
it	1
always	1
touched	1
the	1
ground	1
directly	1
so	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
_very_	1
little	1
way	1
to	1
fall	1
you	1
see	1
but	1
there	1
_was_	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
falling	1
_into_	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
once	1
and	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
before	1
i	1
could	1
get	1
out	1
again	1
the	1
other	1
white	1
knight	1
came	1
and	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
helmet	1
	1
the	1
knight	1
looked	1
so	1
solemn	1
about	1
it	1
that	1
alice	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
laugh	1
i	1
m	1
afraid	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
hurt	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
voice	1
being	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
kick	1
him	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
knight	1
said	1
very	1
seriously	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
helmet	1
off	1
again	1
but	1
it	1
took	1
hours	1
and	1
hours	1
to	1
get	1
me	1
out	1
i	1
was	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
as	1
lightning	1
you	1
know	1
	1
but	1
that	1
s	1
a	1
different	1
kind	1
of	1
fastness	1
alice	1
objected	1
	1
the	1
knight	1
shook	1
his	1
head	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
fastness	1
with	1
me	1
i	1
can	1
assure	1
you	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
some	1
excitement	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
and	1
instantly	1
rolled	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
saddle	1
and	1
fell	1
headlong	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
ditch	1
	1
alice	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ditch	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
rather	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
fall	1
as	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
kept	1
on	1
very	1
well	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
he	1
really	1
_was_	1
hurt	1
this	1
time	1
however	1
though	1
she	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
soles	1
of	1
his	1
feet	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
relieved	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
talking	1
on	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
tone	1
all	1
kinds	1
of	1
fastness	1
he	1
repeated	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
careless	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
another	1
man	1
s	1
helmet	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
it	1
too	1
	1
how	1
_can_	1
you	1
go	1
on	1
talking	1
so	1
quietly	1
head	1
downwards	1
alice	1
asked	1
as	1
she	1
dragged	1
him	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
heap	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
	1
the	1
knight	1
looked	1
surprised	1
at	1
the	1
question	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
where	1
my	1
body	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
he	1
said	1
my	1
mind	1
goes	1
on	1
working	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
fact	1
the	1
more	1
head	1
downwards	1
i	1
am	1
the	1
more	1

keep	1
inventing	1
new	1
things	1
	1
now	1
the	1
cleverest	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
that	1
i	1
ever	1
did	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
after	1
a	1
pause	1
was	1
inventing	1
a	1
new	1
pudding	1
during	1
the	1
meat	1
course	1
	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
cooked	1
for	1

alice	1
well	1
not	1
the	1

the	1

in	1
a	1
slow	1
thoughtful	1
tone	1
no	1
certainly	1
not	1
the	1
next	1

	1
then	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
the	1

two	1
pudding	1
courses	1
in	1
one	1
dinner	1

well	1

in	1
fact	1

went	1
on	1

his	1

down	1

his	1
voice	1
getting	1
lower	1

lower	1
i	1
don	1

up	1

through	1

shining	1
on	1

trickled	1
through	1
my	1
head	1
like	1
water	1
through	1
a	1
sieve	1
	1
he	1

thinking	1
of	1
a	1
plan	1
to	1
dye	1
one	1

whiskers	1
green	1
and	1
always	1

so	1
large	1
a	1

i	1
cried	1
come	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
you	1
live	1
and	1
thumped	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
	1
his	1
accents	1
mild	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
tale	1
he	1
said	1
i	1
go	1
my	1
ways	1
and	1
when	1
i	1
find	1
a	1
mountain	1
rill	1
i	1
set	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
blaze	1
and	1
thence	1
they	1
make	1
a	1
stuff	1
they	1
call	1
rolands	1
macassar	1

yet	1
twopence	1
halfpenny	1

all	1
they	1
give	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
toil	1
	1
but	1

was	1
thinking	1
of	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
feed	1
oneself	1
on	1
batter	1
and	1
so	1
go	1
on	1
from	1
day	1
to	1
day	1
getting	1
a	1
little	1
fatter	1
i	1
shook	1
him	1
well	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
until	1

face	1
was	1
blue	1

me	1
how	1

cried	1
and	1
what	1

said	1
i	1
hunt	1
for	1
haddocks	1

among	1
the	1
heather	1
bright	1
and	1
work	1
them	1
into	1
waistcoat	1
buttons	1
in	1
the	1
silent	1
night	1
and	1
these	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
sell	1
for	1
gold	1
or	1
coin	1
of	1
silvery	1
shine	1
but	1
for	1
a	1
copper	1
halfpenny	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
purchase	1

	1
i	1
sometimes	1
dig	1
for	1
buttered	1
rolls	1
or	1
set	1
limed	1
twigs	1
for	1
crabs	1
i	1
sometimes	1
search	1
the	1
grassy	1
knolls	1
for	1
wheels	1
of	1
hansom	1
cabs	1
and	1
that	1
s	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
wink	1
by	1
which	1
i	1
get	1
my	1
wealth	1
and	1
very	1
gladly	1
will	1
i	1
drink	1
your	1
honour	1
s	1
noble	1
health	1
	1
i	1
heard	1
him	1
then	1
for	1
i	1
had	1
just	1
completed	1
my	1
design	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
menai	1
bridge	1
from	1
rust	1
by	1
boiling	1
it	1
in	1
wine	1
i	1
thanked	1
him	1
much	1
for	1
telling	1
me	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
got	1
his	1
wealth	1
but	1
chiefly	1
for	1
his	1
wish	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
drink	1
my	1
noble	1
health	1
	1
and	1
now	1
if	1
e	1
er	1
by	1
chance	1
i	1
put	1
my	1
fingers	1
into	1
glue	1
or	1
madly	1
squeeze	1
a	1
right	1
hand	1
foot	1
into	1
a	1
left	1
hand	1
shoe	1
or	1
if	1
i	1
drop	1
upon	1
my	1
toe	1
a	1
very	1
heavy	1
weight	1
i	1
weep	1
for	1
it	1
reminds	1
me	1
so	1
of	1
that	1
old	1
man	1
i	1
used	1
to	1
know	1
whose	1
look	1
was	1
mild	1
whose	1
speech	1
was	1
slow	1
whose	1
hair	1
was	1
whiter	1
than	1
the	1
snow	1
whose	1
face	1
was	1
very	1
like	1
a	1
crow	1
with	1
eyes	1
like	1
cinders	1
all	1
aglow	1
who	1
seemed	1
distracted	1
with	1
his	1
woe	1
who	1
rocked	1
his	1
body	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
and	1
muttered	1
mumblingly	1
and	1
low	1
as	1
if	1
his	1
mouth	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
dough	1
who	1
snorted	1
like	1
a	1
buffalo	1
that	1
summer	1
evening	1
long	1
ago	1
a	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
gate	1
	1
	1
as	1
the	1
knight	1
sang	1
the	1
last	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
ballad	1
he	1
gathered	1
up	1
the	1
reins	1
and	1
turned	1
his	1
horse	1
s	1
head	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
you	1
ve	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
yards	1
to	1
go	1
he	1
said	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
over	1
that	1
little	1
brook	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
ll	1
be	1
a	1
queen	1
but	1
you	1
ll	1
stay	1
and	1
see	1
me	1
off	1
first	1
he	1
added	1
as	1
alice	1
turned	1
with	1
an	1
eager	1
look	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
pointed	1
i	1
shan	1
t	1
be	1
long	1
you	1
ll	1
wait	1
and	1
wave	1
your	1
handkerchief	1
when	1
i	1
get	1
to	1
that	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
road	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
ll	1
encourage	1
me	1
you	1
see	1
	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
ll	1
wait	1
said	1
alice	1
and	1
thank	1
you	1
very	1
much	1
for	1
coming	1
so	1
far	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
song	1
i	1
liked	1
it	1
very	1
much	1
	1
i	1
hope	1
so	1
the	1
knight	1
said	1
doubtfully	1
but	1
you	1
didn	1
t	1
cry	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
i	1
thought	1
you	1
would	1
	1
so	1
they	1
shook	1
hands	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
knight	1
rode	1
slowly	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
forest	1
it	1
won	1
t	1
take	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
_off_	1
i	1
expect	1
alice	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
stood	1
watching	1
him	1
there	1
he	1
goes	1
right	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
usual	1
however	1
he	1
gets	1
on	1
again	1
pretty	1
easily	1
that	1
comes	1
of	1
having	1
so	1
many	1
things	1
hung	1
round	1
the	1
horse	1
so	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
talking	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
the	1
horse	1
walking	1
leisurely	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
the	1
knight	1
tumbling	1
off	1
first	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
then	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
after	1
the	1
fourth	1
or	1
fifth	1
tumble	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
turn	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
waved	1
her	1
handkerchief	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
waited	1
till	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
sight	1
	1
i	1
hope	1
it	1
encouraged	1
him	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
she	1
turned	1
to	1
run	1
down	1
the	1
hill	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
brook	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
queen	1
how	1
grand	1
it	1
sounds	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
steps	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1

	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
and	1
threw	1
herself	1
down	1
to	1
rest	1
on	1
a	1
lawn	1
as	1
soft	1
as	1
moss	1
with	1
little	1
flower	1
beds	1
dotted	1
about	1
it	1
here	1
and	1
there	1
oh	1
how	1
glad	1
i	1
am	1
to	1
get	1
here	1
and	1
what	1
_is_	1
this	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
she	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
a	1
tone	1
of	1
dismay	1
as	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
hands	1
up	1
to	1
something	1
very	1
heavy	1
and	1
fitted	1
tight	1
all	1
round	1
her	1
head	1
	1
but	1
how	1
_can_	1
it	1
have	1
got	1
there	1
without	1
my	1
knowing	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
she	1
lifted	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
set	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
lap	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
could	1

	1
	1
well	1
this	1

grand	1
said	1
alice	1
i	1
never	1
expected	1
i	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
queen	1
so	1
soon	1
and	1
i	1
ll	1
tell	1
you	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
majesty	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
severe	1
tone	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
rather	1
fond	1
of	1
scolding	1
herself	1
it	1
ll	1
never	1
do	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
lolling	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
like	1
that	1
queens	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
dignified	1
you	1
know	1
	1
so	1
she	1
got	1
up	1
and	1
walked	1
about	1
rather	1
stiffly	1
just	1
at	1
first	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
afraid	1
that	1
the	1
crown	1
might	1
come	1
off	1
but	1
she	1
comforted	1
herself	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
if	1
i	1
really	1
am	1
a	1
queen	1
she	1
said	1
as	1
she	1
sat	1
down	1
again	1
i	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
manage	1
it	1
quite	1
well	1
in	1
time	1
	1
everything	1
was	1
happening	1
so	1
oddly	1
that	1
she	1
didn	1
t	1
feel	1
a	1
bit	1
surprised	1
at	1
finding	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
queen	1
sitting	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
one	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
ask	1
them	1
how	1
they	1
came	1
there	1
but	1
she	1
feared	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
quite	1
civil	1
however	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
harm	1
she	1
thought	1
in	1
asking	1
if	1
the	1
game	1
was	1
over	1
please	1
would	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
she	1
began	1
looking	1
timidly	1
at	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
	1
speak	1
when	1
you	1
re	1
spoken	1
to	1
the	1
queen	1
sharply	1
interrupted	1
her	1
	1
but	1
if	1
everybody	1
obeyed	1
that	1
rule	1
said	1
alice	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
argument	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
spoke	1
when	1
you	1
were	1
spoken	1
to	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
person	1
always	1
waited	1
for	1
_you_	1
to	1
begin	1
you	1
see	1
nobody	1
would	1
ever	1
say	1
anything	1
so	1
that	1
	1
ridiculous	1
cried	1
the	1
queen	1
why	1
don	1
t	1
you	1
see	1
child	1
here	1
she	1
broke	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
frown	1
and	1
after	1
thinking	1
for	1
a	1
minute	1
suddenly	1
changed	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
if	1
you	1
really	1
are	1
a	1
queen	1

sooner	1

it	1
the	1
better	1
	1
i	1
only	1
said	1
if	1

alice	1
pleaded	1
in	1
a	1
piteous	1
tone	1
	1
the	1

at	1

she	1
said	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
white	1
queen	1
moaned	1
wringing	1
her	1
hands	1
oh	1
ever	1

of	1

before	1
alice	1
who	1

from	1
one	1

it	1
off	1
and	1
brought	1
a	1

alice	1
alice	1

remove	1
the	1
pudding	1
and	1
the	1
waiters	1
took	1
it	1
away	1
so	1
quickly	1
that	1
alice	1
couldn	1
t	1
return	1
its	1
bow	1
	1
however	1
she	1
didn	1
t	1

red	1
queen	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
to	1
give	1

an	1
experiment	1
she	1
called	1
out	1

back	1
the	1
pudding	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
was	1
again	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
like	1
a	1
conjuring	1
trick	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
large	1
that	1
she	1
couldn	1
t	1
help	1
feeling	1
a	1
_little_	1
shy	1
with	1
it	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
the	1
mutton	1
however	1
she	1
conquered	1
her	1
shyness	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
effort	1
and	1
cut	1
a	1
slice	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
	1
what	1
impertinence	1
said	1
the	1

wonder	1
how	1
you	1
d	1
like	1
it	1
if	1
i	1
were	1
to	1
cut	1

out	1
of	1
_you_	1
you	1
creature	1
	1
it	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
thick	1
suety	1
sort	1
of	1
voice	1
and	1
alice	1
hadn	1
t	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
reply	1
she	1
could	1
only	1
sit	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
and	1
gasp	1
	1
make	1
a	1
remark	1
said	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
it	1
s	1
ridiculous	1
to	1
leave	1
all	1
the	1
conversation	1
to	1
the	1
pudding	1
	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
i	1
ve	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
quantity	1
of	1
poetry	1
repeated	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
day	1
alice	1
began	1
a	1
little	1
frightened	1
at	1
finding	1
that	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
opened	1
her	1
lips	1
there	1
was	1
dead	1
silence	1
and	1
all	1
eyes	1
were	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her	1
and	1
it	1
s	1
a	1
very	1
curious	1
thing	1
i	1
think	1
every	1
poem	1
was	1
about	1
fishes	1
in	1
some	1
way	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
why	1
they	1
re	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
fishes	1
all	1
about	1
here	1
	1
she	1
spoke	1
to	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
whose	1
answer	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
wide	1
of	1
the	1
mark	1
as	1
to	1
fishes	1
she	1
said	1
very	1
slowly	1
and	1
solemnly	1
putting	1
her	1
mouth	1
close	1
to	1
alice	1
s	1
ear	1
her	1
white	1
majesty	1
knows	1
a	1
lovely	1
riddle	1
all	1
in	1
poetry	1
all	1
about	1
fishes	1
shall	1
she	1
repeat	1
it	1
	1
her	1
red	1
majesty	1
s	1
very	1
kind	1
to	1
mention	1
it	1
the	1
white	1
queen	1
murmured	1
into	1
alice	1
s	1
other	1
ear	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
like	1
the	1
cooing	1
of	1
a	1
pigeon	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
_such_	1
a	1
treat	1
may	1
i	1
	1
please	1
do	1
alice	1
said	1
very	1
politely	1
	1
the	1
white	1
queen	1
laughed	1
with	1
delight	1
and	1
stroked	1
alice	1
s	1
cheek	1
then	1
she	1
began	1
	1
first	1
the	1
fish	1
must	1
be	1
caught	1
that	1
is	1
easy	1
a	1
baby	1
i	1
think	1
could	1
have	1
caught	1
it	1
next	1
the	1
fish	1
must	1
be	1
bought	1
that	1
is	1
easy	1
a	1
penny	1
i	1
think	1
would	1
have	1
bought	1
it	1
	1
now	1
cook	1
me	1
the	1
fish	1
that	1
is	1
easy	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
minute	1
let	1
it	1
lie	1
in	1
a	1
dish	1
that	1
is	1
easy	1
because	1
it	1
already	1
is	1
in	1
it	1
	1
bring	1
it	1
here	1
let	1
me	1
sup	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
set	1
such	1
a	1
dish	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
take	1
the	1
dish	1
cover	1
up	1
ah	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
hard	1
that	1
i	1
fear	1
i	1
m	1
unable	1
	1
for	1
it	1
holds	1
it	1
like	1
glue	1
holds	1
the	1
lid	1
to	1
the	1
dish	1
while	1
it	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1

is	1
easiest	1
to	1
do	1
un	1

the	1

	1
	1
take	1
a	1
minute	1
to	1
think	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
then	1
guess	1
said	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
meanwhile	1
we	1
ll	1
drink	1
your	1
health	1
queen	1
alice	1
s	1
health	1
she	1
screamed	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
guests	1
began	1
drinking	1
it	1
directly	1
and	1
very	1
queerly	1
they	1
managed	1
it	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
put	1
their	1
glasses	1
upon	1
their	1
heads	1
like	1
extinguishers	1
and	1
drank	1
all	1
that	1
trickled	1
down	1
their	1
faces	1
others	1
upset	1
the	1
decanters	1
and	1
drank	1
the	1
wine	1
as	1
it	1
ran	1
off	1
the	1
edges	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
looked	1
like	1
kangaroos	1
scrambled	1
into	1
the	1
dish	1
of	1
roast	1
mutton	1
and	1
began	1
eagerly	1
lapping	1
up	1
the	1
gravy	1
just	1
like	1
pigs	1
in	1
a	1
trough	1
thought	1
alice	1
	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
return	1
thanks	1
in	1
a	1
neat	1
speech	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
said	1
frowning	1
at	1
alice	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
	1
we	1
must	1
support	1
you	1
you	1
know	1
the	1
white	1
queen	1
whispered	1
as	1
alice	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
very	1
obediently	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
frightened	1
	1
thank	1
you	1
very	1
much	1
she	1
whispered	1
in	1
reply	1
but	1
i	1
can	1
do	1
quite	1
well	1
without	1
	1
that	1
wouldn	1
t	1
be	1
at	1
all	1
the	1
thing	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
said	1
very	1
decidedly	1
so	1
alice	1
tried	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
grace	1
	1
and	1
they	1
_did_	1
push	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
afterwards	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
telling	1
her	1
sister	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
squeeze	1
me	1
flat	1
	1
in	1
fact	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
difficult	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
keep	1
in	1
her	1
place	1
while	1
she	1
made	1
her	1
speech	1
the	1
two	1
queens	1
pushed	1
her	1
so	1
one	1
on	1
each	1
side	1
that	1
they	1
nearly	1
lifted	1
her	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
i	1
rise	1
to	1
return	1
thanks	1
alice	1
began	1
and	1
she	1
really	1
_did_	1
rise	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
several	1
inches	1
but	1
she	1
got	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
managed	1
to	1
pull	1
herself	1
down	1
again	1
	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
yourself	1
screamed	1
the	1
white	1
queen	1
seizing	1
alice	1
s	1
hair	1
with	1
both	1
her	1
hands	1
something	1
s	1
going	1
to	1
happen	1
	1
and	1
then	1
as	1
alice	1
afterwards	1
described	1
it	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
things	1
happened	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
the	1
candles	1
all	1
grew	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
ceiling	1
looking	1
something	1
like	1
a	1
bed	1
of	1
rushes	1
with	1
fireworks	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
bottles	1
they	1
each	1
took	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
plates	1
which	1
they	1
hastily	1
fitted	1
on	1
as	1
wings	1
and	1
so	1
with	1
forks	1
for	1
legs	1
went	1
fluttering	1
about	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
and	1
very	1
like	1
birds	1
they	1
look	1
alice	1
thought	1
to	1
herself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
in	1
the	1
dreadful	1
confusion	1
that	1
was	1
beginning	1
	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
she	1
heard	1
a	1
hoarse	1
laugh	1
at	1
her	1
side	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
queen	1
but	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
queen	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
leg	1
of	1
mutton	1
sitting	1
in	1
the	1
chair	1
here	1
i	1
am	1
cried	1
a	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
soup	1
tureen	1
and	1
alice	1
turned	1
again	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
queen	1
s	1
broad	1
good	1
natured	1
face	1
grinning	1
at	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
over	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
the	1
tureen	1
before	1
she	1
disappeared	1
into	1
the	1
soup	1
	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
be	1
lost	1
already	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
lying	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
dishes	1
and	1
the	1
soup	1
ladle	1
was	1
walking	1
up	1
the	1
table	1
towards	1
alice	1
s	1
chair	1
and	1
beckoning	1
to	1
her	1
impatiently	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
its	1
way	1
	1
i	1
can	1
t	1
stand	1
this	1
any	1
longer	1
she	1
cried	1
as	1
she	1
jumped	1
up	1
and	1
seized	1
the	1
table	1
cloth	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
one	1
good	1
pull	1
and	1
plates	1
dishes	1
guests	1
and	1
candles	1
came	1
crashing	1
down	1
together	1
in	1
a	1
heap	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
_you_	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
turning	1
fiercely	1
upon	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
whom	1
she	1
considered	1
as	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mischief	1
but	1
the	1
queen	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
at	1
her	1
side	1
she	1
had	1
suddenly	1
dwindled	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
doll	1
and	1
was	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
merrily	1
running	1
round	1
and	1
round	1
after	1
her	1
own	1
shawl	1
which	1
was	1
trailing	1
behind	1
her	1
	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
time	1
alice	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
surprised	1
at	1
this	1
but	1
she	1
was	1
far	1
too	1
much	1
excited	1
to	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
anything	1
_now_	1
as	1
for	1
_you_	1
she	1
repeated	1
catching	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
little	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
act	1
of	1
jumping	1
over	1
a	1
bottle	1
which	1
had	1
just	1
lighted	1
upon	1
the	1
table	1

	1
	1
she	1
took	1
her	1
off	1
the	1
table	1
as	1
she	1
spoke	1
and	1
shook	1
her	1
backwards	1
and	1
forwards	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
might	1
	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
made	1
no	1
resistance	1
whatever	1
only	1
her	1
face	1
grew	1
very	1
small	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
got	1
large	1
and	1
green	1
and	1
still	1
as	1
alice	1
went	1
on	1
shaking	1
her	1
she	1
kept	1
on	1
growing	1
shorter	1

chapter	1

waking	1
	1
	1
and	1
it	1
really	1
_was_	1
a	1
kitten	1
after	1
all	1
	1
	1
	1
	1
chapter	1
xii	1
which	1
dreamed	1
it	1
	1
	1
your	1
majesty	1
shouldn	1
t	1
purr	1
so	1
loud	1
alice	1
said	1
rubbing	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
addressing	1
the	1
kitten	1
respectfully	1
yet	1
with	1
some	1
severity	1
you	1
woke	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
oh	1
such	1
a	1
nice	1
dream	1
and	1
you	1
ve	1
been	1
along	1
with	1
me	1
kitty	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
looking	1
glass	1
world	1
did	1
you	1
know	1
it	1
dear	1
	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
inconvenient	1
habit	1
of	1
kittens	1
alice	1
had	1
once	1
made	1
the	1
remark	1
that	1
whatever	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
them	1
they	1
_always_	1
purr	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
only	1
purr	1
for	1
yes	1
and	1
mew	1
for	1
no	1
or	1
any	1
rule	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
so	1
that	1
one	1
could	1
keep	1
up	1
a	1
conversation	1
but	1
how	1
_can_	1
you	1
talk	1
with	1
a	1
person	1
if	1
they	1
always	1
say	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
the	1
kitten	1
only	1
purred	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
guess	1
whether	1
it	1
meant	1
yes	1
or	1
no	1
	1
so	1
alice	1
hunted	1
among	1
the	1
chessmen	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
till	1
she	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
then	1
she	1
went	1
down	1
on	1
her	1
knees	1
on	1
the	1
hearth	1
rug	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
kitten	1
and	1
the	1
queen	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
each	1
other	1
now	1
kitty	1
she	1
cried	1
clapping	1
her	1
hands	1
triumphantly	1
confess	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
you	1
turned	1
into	1
	1
but	1
it	1
wouldn	1
t	1
look	1
at	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
explaining	1
the	1
thing	1
afterwards	1
to	1
her	1
sister	1
it	1
turned	1
away	1
its	1
head	1
and	1
pretended	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
but	1
it	1
looked	1
a	1
_little_	1
ashamed	1
of	1
itself	1
so	1
i	1
think	1
it	1
_must_	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
red	1
queen	1
	1
sit	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
stiffly	1
dear	1
alice	1
cried	1
with	1
a	1
merry	1
laugh	1
and	1
curtsey	1
while	1
you	1
re	1
thinking	1
what	1
to	1
what	1
to	1
purr	1
it	1
saves	1
time	1
remember	1
and	1
she	1
caught	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
one	1
little	1
kiss	1
just	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
red	1
queen	1
	1
snowdrop	1
my	1
pet	1
she	1
went	1
on	1
looking	1
over	1
her	1
shoulder	1
at	1
the	1
white	1
kitten	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
patiently	1
undergoing	1
its	1
toilet	1
when	1
_will_	1
dinah	1
have	1
finished	1
with	1
your	1
white	1
majesty	1
i	1
wonder	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
reason	1
you	1
were	1
so	1
untidy	1
in	1
my	1
dream	1
dinah	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
re	1
scrubbing	1
a	1
white	1
queen	1
really	1
it	1
s	1
most	1
disrespectful	1
of	1
you	1
	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
_dinah_	1
turn	1
to	1
i	1
wonder	1
she	1
prattled	1
on	1
as	1
she	1
settled	1
comfortably	1
down	1
with	1
one	1
elbow	1
in	1
the	1
rug	1
and	1
her	1
chin	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
kittens	1
tell	1
me	1
dinah	1
did	1
you	1
turn	1
to	1
humpty	1
dumpty	1
i	1
_think_	1
you	1
did	1
however	1
you	1
d	1
better	1
not	1
mention	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
friends	1
just	1
yet	1
for	1
i	1
m	1
not	1

	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
kitty	1
if	1
only	1
you	1
d	1
been	1
really	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
dream	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
thing	1
you	1
_would_	1
have	1
enjoyed	1
i	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
quantity	1
of	1
poetry	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
about	1

to	1

morning	1
you	1
shall	1

a	1

all	1
the	1
time	1

repeat	1
the	1
walrus	1
and	1
the	1
carpenter	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
then	1
you	1

	1
now	1

consider	1
who	1
it	1

all	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
serious	1
question	1
my	1
dear	1
and	1
you	1
should	1
_not_	1
go	1
on	1
licking	1
your	1
paw	1
like	1
that	1
as	1
if	1
dinah	1

washed	1
you	1
this	1
morning	1

_must_	1
have	1
been	1
either	1
me	1
or	1
the	1
red	1
king	1
he	1
was	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
dream	1
of	1

then	1
i	1
was	1

it	1
the	1
red	1
king	1
kitty	1
